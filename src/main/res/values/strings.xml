        <br><big><b>Boomerang superjump</b></big>
        <br>The boomerang superjump is a superjump glitch that can be performed by either Link or Young
        Link in Super Smash Bros. Melee. 
        <br>It is done by throwing their boomerang, and then wall-grappling
        on a wall or the side of a stage. If performed correctly, the boomerang will fly into Link/Young
        Link and they will immediately fly high up into the air in a tumble animation and after sometime
        it will end, although if an action is done to cancel the tumble Link will stop rising in the air.
        <br>
        <br>This glitch was removed from the 1.2 and PAL versions of the game.

    <string name="chillindash_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Chillin dash</b></big>
        <br>Fox and Falco can perform a technique referred to as Chillin dashing, named after
        Chillindude829, in Super Smash Bros. Melee. It is performed by running off the edge,
        and at the moment the character is going to fall off, the character must use the
        Reflector and perform a jump shine. Covering a decent distance, it is useful for
        edgeguarding. It is generally followed up by a jump canceled back aerial.
        <br>This technique is better to use than jumping off the stage to edge guard far away
        because the chillin dash travels farther than a jump by Fox or Falco.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br><b>Step 1:</b>Sprint towards ledge (Slam grey stick horizontally)
        <br><b>Step 2:</b>Input shine right before you are about to leave the ground. (Release grey stick and shine, or quartercircle down into b input, both seem to work as long as you\'re quick)
        <br><b>Step 3:</b>Continue holding shine if you wish to jump out of it, otherwise, let it fade.

    <string name="desync_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Desynching</b></big>
        <br>Desynching is an Ice Climbers technique that involves
        separating the two climbers\' states and controlling them individually. It is most commonly
        done during grabs to allow Nana to attack a captive opponent or regrab them, but the Ice
        Climbers can be desynched out of many attacks, allowing the player to perform an attack,
        move, jump, or wavedash with either Nana or Popo, while inputting a different command
        to the other Ice Climber.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>The easiest way to start desynching is by doing an attack at the time the Ice Climber
        the player controls (usually Popo) can\'t attack, while the other can. For example, by doing
        an attack (with a certain timing) after a spot dodge, only Nana will do the attack. The
        timing can be practiced by taunting after a spot dodge; if only one Ice Climber taunts,
        desynching has been achieved.
        <br>Another way to jump desync is to lightly tap the control stick up, very lightly.
        If done properly, only Popo will jump and Nana will stay on the ground.
        <br>More info is here: http://smashboards.com/threads/new-no-setup-ic-jump-desync.366189/
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Continuous desynch</b></big>
        <br>Continuous desynch, as demonstrated in Two Climbers, Two Hands is a technique
        which involves keeping the Climbers acting individually for extended periods of time.
        In addition to making the Climbers much more powerful offensively, they also
        become harder to approach with continuous desynch. 
        <br>Due to the extreme difficulty of
        timing and maintaining a continuous string of attacks, the in-combat potential of this
        approach is clearly substantial, but largely untapped.

    <string name="djc_info_text"><![CDATA[Examples of DJC: https://youtu.be/O2Oa60lfkyo
        <br>https://youtu.be/hBTgDxEqHw0
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Double jump cancel</b></big>
        <br>The double jump cancel, sometimes abbreviated as DJC,
        is a technique used by Ness, Mewtwo, Peach, and Yoshi, who can attack
        immediately after their double jump to cancel their upward momentum and land
        on the ground soon after their attack. This tactic is used to perform aerial
        attacks incredibly quickly, thus allowing aerial combos and KO\'s to be
        performed more quickly.
        <br>
        <br><b>Ness</b>
        <br>Ness can use the technique, though it is not very useful but still relatively powerful.
        <br>
        <br><b>Peach</b>
        <br>Peach can use this technique, but it is generally unused due to float 
        canceling being significantly quicker and more useful.
        <br>
        <br><b>Yoshi</b>
        <br>Yoshi has the ability to \"block the knockback\" of attacks because of his 
        double jump\'s unique knockback armor, and is often used to catch the opponent offguard with an aerial.
        <br>One downside of this is the lack of a standard recovery, so messing up and being taken offstage
        limits Yoshi\'s recovery options to a directional air dodge.
        <br>
        <br><b>Mewtwo</b>
        <br>Mewtwo gains a significant advantage from DJC. The best use of the DJC for
        Mewtwo is speeding up its forward aerial, though it can be used to assist its up aerial and back aerial as well. 
        <br>
        <br><big><b>DJC physics</b></big>
        <br>Since the affected characters\' double jumps are of the \"delayed\" type (where they do not rise immediately), interrupting
        the action with an attack will cause the scheduled upwards force to not take place.
        A similar mechanic can cause superjumps.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Double jump cancel fast fall L-cancel</b></big>
        <br>Double jump cancel fast fall L-cancel (abbreviated as \"DJCFFL") is a tactic that is simply a quicker application of the
        double jump cancel, and is most often used by Ness, Mewtwo, and Yoshi in Melee. It allows the character in question to
        attack aerially even faster than with a SHFFL\'d aerial.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Instant double jump cancel</b></big>
        <br>Double Jump Canceling works by allowing the user to perform an air attack while remaining close to the ground (most aerial
        attacks are performed at a short hop\'s distance from the ground). However, if the user performs a DJC with frame-perfect
        precision (known as an \"Instant Double Jump Cancel\" or IDJC), they will actually hit the ground before the hitbox from their
        air attack comes out. This is true of every attack for every character who can DJC.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Execution</b></big>
        <br>To perform this technique, the player must perform their first jump, then double jump just as they leave the ground, and
        perform an aerial around the start of the \"rising\" in the double jump. The player\'s double jump will be canceled and they will do the attack and immediately fall. The player may fast
        fall almost immediately. The result will cause the character using this technique
        to attack extremely quickly.

    <string name="doublejump_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Double jump refresh</b></big>
        <br>Captain Falcon and Ganondorf can refresh their double jumps by performing their Down-B attacks.
        This means they can jump, double jump, Down-B, and then double jump again.
        <br>This technique is often used when CF or Ganon have been smashed into the upper right or left areas
        of the stage, as a means of mixing up their recovery.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>When to use</b></big>
        <br>You should use this technique when you are sent upwards and off the stage high enough
        so that if you were to perform the Down-B you wouldn\'t SD by the endlag sending you into the bottom
        blastzone.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Extended grapple</b></big>
        <br>Samus\' extended grapple is a technique that allows Samus to extend the length of her grab.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>Samus can extend the length of her Grapple Beam if the player presses Z, then up,
        down, and up on the control pad (The D-Pad you use for taunts), then Z again.
        This combo must be inputted between frames 8-39 of the grab (the part of the
        grab before the grapple becomes visible). If successful,
        the Grapple Beam will extend to approximately 3 times its normal length.
        <br>
        <br>This technique was removed in the PAL version of Melee.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Edge-canceled eggs</b></big>
        <br>Edge-canceled eggs (abbreviated \"ECE\") is a
        technique for Yoshi that is performed by releasing from the edge, pressing
        down or away from the edge, double jumping, and then throwing an egg.
        After the egg is thrown, the player can grab onto the edge, canceling 
        all lag and renewing the edge invincibility frames. Note that the invicibility does not cover all
        of the ECE, it ends after the egg is launched if performed perfectly.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Usefulness</b></big>
        <br>Edge-canceled eggs is a rather useful technique allowing Yoshi to
        easily camp, space, and play defensively while countering opponent approaches. The reverse edge-canceled
        eggs technique is a pretty risky but useful edgeguarding tactic if one can perform it consistently,
        giving Yoshi strong ledge play.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>The best way to do it is to start by simply double jumping higher than the edge, and throwing an egg, and letting yourself
        fall to the edge again. Then, slowly work your way down, reducing the amount of double jump you use each time. This way,
        you’ll get faster at it, and not die all the time. Also, remember that in battle, it is not the speed you can edge egg
        at that counts; it is whether you can time it right. The speed comes with time, but the timing is much more important.
        <br>Remember to always have your finger poised above the midair dodge button, especially when edge egging, because you never
        know when you might need to use it.

    <string name="fcancel_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Float cancel</b></big>
        <br>Every character can cancel some of the endlag of their aerials by pressing L, R or Z seven frames before
        landing. This technique is known as L-canceling, and it will cut the lag of the attack in half.
        The Peach labeled "LCAN" is using this technique, and suffers from 12 frames of lag.
        <br>Peach has a special sort of cancel in her toolbox. By performing an aerial out of her Float,
        all of her aerial attacks will suffer only 4 frames of lag as opposed to as many as 25(from her laggiest
        aerial, her Forward Air). This technique is known as Float Canceling, and is being performed by
        the Peach labeled "FCAN".
        <br>The FCAN Peach is also using a technique that allows her to instantly float by holding down
        on the control stick and a jump button, known as Auto-floating.

    <string name="frozenturnip_info_text"><![CDATA[big><b>Frozen turnip glitch</b></big>
        <br>The frozen turnip glitch is a glitch on the 1.00 NTSC version of Melee that
        will cause a turnip to not travel any distance when thrown and will remain frozen
        in air with the hitbox still active. The turnip will stay in place indefinitely
        and won\'t disappear after a set amount of time.
        <br>This means you can leave a turnip as a
        remote hitbox to temporarily control a part of the stage or set it offstage by the
        ledge to intercept an opponents recovery. The hitbox is deactivated after hitting
        an opponent but if the turnip is picked up and thrown the turnip will become frozen
        in this new position with a reactivated hitbox. When a frozen turnip has an active
        hitbox it can be used to repeatedly hit shields without deactivating the hitbox,
        the turnip will hit the shield every 17 frames until the shield is pushed out of range.
        <br>
        <br><b>Grab side effects</b>
        <br>The frozen turnip has a side effect of enlarging its grab range, the grab range expands
        each time it is thrown. http://gfycat.com/AdeptYellowBorderterrier (grey area is the grab
        range)
        <br>Since the turnips don\'t disappear and can be regrabbed and thrown this means
        that a frozen turnip could be used for the rest of the match and could essentially
        remove both the ability for either players to use tilts or jabs since it will cause
        them to pick up the turnip. The only way for the enemy to remove the turnip is to
        die with it in their hand. Peach is capable of returning the turnip to normal by
        using her parasol while holding the turnip.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Grab an item (turnip, sword, etc.)
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Have an opponent (or team member) hit you on the first frame of
        Peach\'s Up-B.
        <br><b>Step 3:</b> Have fun.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To do the homing extended grapple, one must perform the extended grapple and press L as the
        extended grapple beam pulls out. The beam will the move towards the nearest opponent; however,
        unlike the normal Grapple Beam, one needs to press A or Z when the tip of the beam is over
        the enemy in order to grab them.

    <string name="knockbackarmor_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Double jump knockback armor</b></big>
        <br>The double jump knockback armor, (Also called double jump cancel counter, abbreviated DJCC)
        is a technique unique to Yoshi. Yoshi\'s midair jump has knockback
        armor and will continue its momentum after the appropriate freeze-frames are applied against all attacks with
        knockback below 120.
        <br>The DJ knockback armor utilizes this protection to allow Yoshi to jump into an opponent, take a hit, and proceed to follow up with a
        counterattack almost immediately.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform the technique, start by simply double-jumping at an opponent within their attacking range. They will likely
        attack the player, and Yoshi will absorb the hit (taking all applicable damage), and be able to immediately counterattack
        or float away in the direction they were previously headed. Any aerial or special move can be done immediately after impact,
        but the most common are Yoshi\'s faster aerial attacks (such as neutral aerial) or his Egg Lay.
        <br>This can also be used to recover by double jumping up to the stage and taking in the opponents hit
        to wavedash onto the stage and space yourself until you have space to fight.

        <br>A detailed instruction on the execution of LHDL: https://youtu.be/FF_YhidQ_NE
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Ledgehop double laser</b></big>
        <br>The ledgehopped double laser, or LHDL, is a technique that can be performed with both Fox
        and Falco, though it is far more useful and common among Falco players due to the superiority of his laser.
        <br>The technique was popularized in Melee by Japanese Falco player Bombsoldier. Though it sounds
        simple in theory, the real trick is having the lasers travel at the proper height that the player wants.
        <br>If the player simply ledgehops as they normally would and tap the special button repeatedly, they will likely end up with
        two lasers that are extremely high and not at the same height. So the proper way to LHDL requires the player to drop from
        the edge a small amount, full hop, start tapping B immediately after jumping,
        so that the player fires one laser as they pass the ledge going up, and the second as they fall back onto the
        stage.
        <br>A variation of this technique, that doesn\'t involve ledgehopping at all, is to run off the stage, drop for a bit, and use
        the midair jump to reverse double laser back onto the stage. The player Westballz commonly uses this technique.
        <br>This move is semi-unsafe if the opponent is right next to the ledge so players have done it less commonly since other
        players are able to punish them.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>The LHDL is done by dropping down from the ledge, jumping after a height similar to the gif above,
        and then firing two lasers by tapping B twice with proper timing, and controlling your movement with the control stick.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Multishine</b></big>
        <br>A multishine is the repeated use of Fox or Falco\'s Down-B (shine or reflector).
        It is performed by jump-canceling a reflector and
        using a second reflector just after leaving the ground, timed so that Fox or Falco will quickly land and allow the
        pattern to be repeated. It is a very difficult and technically demanding technique and is often practiced at slower
        speeds in training mode, though it is easier to perform with Falco as his jump squat animation is 2 frames longer.
        <br>Note: To get the hang of multishining, timing is very important, especially with Falco. See the timing movement
        you used every time you land a multishine and focus on repeating it.

        <br><big><b>Parry</b></big>
        <br>Also called supershielding, parrying is a technique used by Yoshi players that takes advantage of the
        invincibility during \"guard on\" (the 6 frames of invincibility at the start of the shield)
        as well as the ability to jump during this time. Instead of blocking attacks
        with his powershield, parrying involves blocking attacks with Yoshi\'s invincible body, most often his head,
        and then jumping or grabbing to avoid the lengthy unshielding animation.
        <br>You can also crouch and pivot parry.  Crouch parry allows you to cancel whatever you were doing (or
        respond to an attack by crouch canceling and responding with a parry into attack) to enter the shield in
        order to parry.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>Parry can be performed by shielding (full press, not light shielding), and then
        immediately following up with one of the actions listed below. Note that the actions must be done within
        the first frame of shielding, as only the second frame is jump cancellable without any drawbacks; the
        other frames will cause shieldstun onto Yoshi.

        <br><big><b>Pillaring</b></big>
        <br>Pillaring refers to pressuring an opponent\'s shield by utilizing a combination of techniques
        (SHFFLs, aerials, and shines) performed by Fox and Falco. 
        <br>The term can also be used for a Falco shine to dair combo as the characters go up and down together, like \"pillars\".
        <br>Pillaring can lead to a defending player rolling out of their shield and being chased or having their shield broken,
        although the latter is rare in high-level play. Pressure from pillaring is usually relieved by a successfully performed
        shield grab or out-of-shield option, such as Samus\'s Screw Attack, Bowser\'s Whirling Fortress, or even Fox\'s shine.
        Characters with poor out-of-shield options are especially vulnerable because a successful shield grab requires very strict timing.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Execution</b></big>
        <br>Pillaring is performed by SHFFL a down aerial and immediately shining. The shine is then jump-canceled into another
        SHFFL\'d down aerial, and the cycle continues. Grabs and other aerials can also be canceled into in place of the down
        aerial. This technique is sometimes used in tandem with waveshines and waveshine infinites and followed up with jabs or down tilts.

    <string name="psspike_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Princess/Swordsman spiking</b></big>
        <br>Princess/Swordsman spiking is done by using Peach, Marth, and Roy\'s counter to
        intentionally setup an invisible ceiling glitch on your opponent. For Peach
        Toad will send them in the same trajectory as normal while it will cause Marth
        and Roy\'s counter to send your opponent away for a short distance and then
        switch to falling straight down. Additionally if this is used on an opponent
        to the left of you and they are sent offstage then the invisible ceiling glitch
        will remain active on them until they recover back on stage or grab the ledge.
        Any moves hitting an opponent off stage will cause your move to lose any vertical
        knockback it has while keeping its horizontal knockback and hitstun the same.
        <br>This means moves with decent hitstun that normally have upward knockback will
        know turn into spikes or semispikes that Peach, Marth, or Roy can use to gimp
        their opponent. Even though there is no downward vertical knockback the hitstun
        is still there and gravity will pull them down.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Press L or R to shield
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Release shield by letting go of trigger or using any out of shield options (jump, roll, grab)
        <br><b>Step 3:</b> Counter one of your opponents grounded attacks
        <br><b>Step 4:</b> Perform an attack on the opponent while they are airborne
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</b></big>
        <br>This likely works because Peach\'s toad hitbox and Marth and Roy\'s counter
        hitbox are very similar to the hitbox of a shield and are color coded as the
        same type of hitbox as shields in debug mode. A standard invisible ceiling
        glitch is triggered by going airborne while still sliding back after a grounded
        attack hits an opponents shield. Which can happen by either getting hit out of
        their attack on shield or for certain characters by walking or dropping through
        a platform after hitting an opponents shield with a specific attack. Normally
        if you hit a counter it won\'t cause any of the shield push back required to
        trigger an invisible ceiling glitch. However once you have used your shield
        earlier on that stock when your opponent attacks your counter they will receive
        the same push back as they would have if they attacked the shield you were
        previously holding up.
        <br>
        <br>Your counter will still be able to trigger the Princess/Swordsman Spike
        until you release a shield when it is incredibly light or the next time
        you die. As far as I can tell moving around, fighting, or using the
        counter do not undo the glitched shield + counter hybrid.
        <br>
        <br><b>How the shield affects the spike</b>
        <br>How light or strong your shield is before you release it has an impact on
        how soon after your counter will trigger the invisible ceiling glitch and
        they will lose their vertical knockback. This is because how light your
        shield is reduces the amount your opponent is pushed back when they hit your
        shield. So if you release a lighter shield that is used for your counter
        they will lose their vertical momentum sooner. If you make your shield too
        light they may not have any sliding back momentum when your counter hits
        which means it will not trigger the invisible ceiling. If you are too
        slow when you release a hard shield the game may register the light
        shield during the time your spring pushed your shoulder button back to
        its resting position so try to release your trigger quickly or use an out
        of shield option to avoid the risk entirely. The stronger a move is that
        hits your counter the longer it takes for your counter to trigger the
        invisible ceiling and the lighter you can hold your shield while still
        triggering the invisible ceiling glitch.

    <string name="rigcancel_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Rising instant grapple cancel</b></big>
        <br>Samus has one of the best recoveries in the game. She can Walljump, Bomb Jump, Grapple, and has a very powerful Up-B.
        <br>One of the most versatile of these options is the Grapple. When used in the air, the beam can latch onto the side of
        the stage. Samus will dangle there until she presses Z or A to pull herself up. If she is grappled perfectly onto the
        ledge, she will sweetspot it upon reeling in. Otherwise, she will rise upwards with the momentum.
        <br>Samus can also airdodge upwards right before grappling to shoot upwards quickly. However, if she is too close to
        the stage when trying to grapple, the move will be canceled and she will go into helpless state.
        <br>By combining these two features (the rising grapple and the grapple cancel), Samus can quickly shoot up in a manner
        similar to her rising grapple, but with less lag at the end. This is because the regular rising grapple causes her to
        go into tumble state. Landing from tumble state will put you on the ground unless you tech it, but even
        teching is slower than simply landing from helpless, which only has 4 frames of landing lag. This is also much less
        than the 24 frames of lag suffered from performing her Up-B.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform this technique, jump close to the side of a stage. Next, Airdodge upwards and immediately press Z.
        If you were too far away, you will perform a standard rising grapple. But if you were close enough, the grapple
        will be canceled and you will fly upwards.
        <br>This is certainly not the safest recovery option for Samus, but it is very quick and if she fails to
        sweetspot the ledge, she suffers from very little lag when landing on the stage.

        <br>One of the odd things about the attack is it can be angled up or down, unlike most Side-B\'s. By angling the

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Short hop laser</b></big>
        <br>The short hop laser (abbreviated to SHL) is a technique usually performed by short hopping with Fox or Falco,
        using their blaster to shoot a laser, and fastfalling (although with Fox\'s you don\'t fastfall).
        <br>The technique has two variants; the short hop double laser (SHDL) and the short hop triple laser (SHTL), for which two and
        three lasers respectively are shot during the short hop and no fastfall is performed.
        <br>Kirby can also perform some of these techniques by copying Fox and Falco\'s blaster abilities using Inhale.
        <br>
        <br>Fox can short hop laser and short hop double laser. Both techniques are used to camp and \"tack on\" small amounts
        of damage, but are much less effective at stopping approaches due to the lack of hitstun that Fox\'s lasers deal. Fox\'s
        short hop laser and short hop double laser are considered more safe and flexible than shooting lasers from the ground,
        for a number of reasons. Short hops can be maneuvered toward or away from the opponent, and the lag caused by landing
        takes less time than that which occurs during a grounded blaster\'s ending lag.
        <br>
        <br>Falco can short hop laser and fast fall while doing so, allowing him to quickly dash after firing a laser, meaning it
        can stun the opponent and allow him to followup with a grab, shine, or other combo starter. His short hop laser is used
        to camp and disrupt opponents\' ground movement and approaches. Continuous strings of Falco\’s short hop lasers are faster
        to execute than continuous grounded lasers.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to SHL with Falco</b></big>
        <br>To SHL with Falco you must short hop, and on the way up press B. Once you reach the peak of your jump, press the control
        stick down to fast fall. Press B at different times to get different heights.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to SHDL with Fox</b></big>
        <br>To SHDL with Fox you must short hop, either by lightly flicking the control stick up or using X or Y, and then press
        B twice immediately after getting off the ground. You do not fast fall for SHDL.

        <br>This technique can become even more effective when combined with platforms, as Samus
        can Land-cancel a Missile on a platform, and then fall through it and Land-cancel a missile

        <br>The super wavedash (sometimes abbreviated as SWD) is a frame-perfect
        physics exploit in Super Smash Bros. Melee that can only be performed by Samus. If the player
        performs it right, they will go a very far distance (about as long as Final Destination),
        however, it is important to release the control stick after the player performs the move,
        otherwise their distance will not be as far. They can also \"Bombhop\" by pressing the direction
        they want to go right before the bomb explodes.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Execution</b></big>
        <br>The super wavedash is a very complicated maneuver and takes a lot of practice to pull
        off. In order to do this, drop a bomb, and as Samus is hitting the ground, immediately
        hit the opposite direction desired on the 41st frame (approximately when Samus lands
        after dropping the bomb), then hit the direction desired on the 42nd frame. This will
        result in Samus sliding across the level, as if in a normal wavedash, but she will go much farther.
        <br>It is possible, with better timing to do a SWD falling from the air, but a bit harder since
        the player does not have the ground to judge the timing as he or she may fall though the air
        from different heights. It is also possible to cancel the SWD in order to avoid a self-destruct.
        Doing any move with the exception of jumping, Sidestepping, using the Charge Shot or Smash
        Attacks will stop the super wave dash.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Detailed instructions</b></big>
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Down b
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Input the opposite direction you want to go just before Samus lands
        <br><b>Step 3:</b> Instantly input the opposite direction (where you want to go) on the next frame
        <br><b>Step 4:</b> Let go of the stick to go the full distance
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Crouched bomb</b></big>
        <br>When crouching and laying a bomb, as opposed to laying a bomb without crouching, Samus will skip the
        first 2 frames in the bomb animation. This means when performing the SWD, the player will hit the opposite
        direction they want to go on the 39th frame, then hit the direction they want to go on the 40th frame.
        In actuality, it still is the exact same position as the regular 41st frame and since they skipped the
        first 2 frames, it can still be argued as being the 41st frame.

        in which this can be performed, and performing it incorrectly will result in a reverse Up-B.
        <br>Because this move has set knockback, and it ends so quickly, this technique is very viable
        for tournament play: the move can be used out of shield to give you breathing room, or as an edge
        guard to set up an f-smash.

        <br><b>Up-B cancel ledgestall</b>
        <br>Doc can also Up-B cancel to the ledge, this allows him to ledgestall and retain invincibility.
        <br>This ledgestall is also very safe, as the Up-B cancel has a hitbox, meaning opponents trying to camp at the
        edge of the stage will need to be defensive while you recover, rather than offensive.

        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform a Up-B cancel, turn the stick to the upwards left/right (the direction
        you want to Up-B cancel) and press B, and within 4 frames move the stick to the upwards
        diagonal of the opposite side you inputted in the first step.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>When to Up-B cancel</b></big>
        <br>Up-B cancels are a very good option out of shield, and are good to set up combos,
        stop shield pressure, mix up jabs and waveland onto stage followups. Just keep in mind
        the character you are attacking has to be closer than Dr. Mario\'s jab range.

    <string name="upbturn_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Up-B turnaround</b></big>
        <br>Characters who have a omnidirectional recovery that is similar to a teleport, such as Mewtwo or
        Sheik, have the ability to turnaround their Up-B. Characters like Pichu and Pikachu can take
        advantage of this to go the same direction twice, which is impossible to do without this technique.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To do this, begin your Up-B. Now at the startup of your Up-B (before your character starts
        to actually moves/vanishes), you must LIGHTLY tilt the control stick in the opposite direction
        you are facing. This tilt must be light enough so that you do not actually travel in that
        direction. The end result will be you traveling upwards and ending up facing the opposite direction.
        <br>Fox and Falco cannot perform this technique, however they can turn around if they touch a wall
        (like the side of FD) when performing the Up-B straight up.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform the Up-B walljump a Mario must Up-B while touching the wall at the start and

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Applications</b></big>
        <br>This allows Mario to recover much better, due to the fact it allows him to Up-B twice or
        use his cape to stall before recovering. It can also be used as a good mix-up.

        <br>When a character wavedashes off a platform or the stage, they lose their momentum when

        <br>This technique is known as a Vududash, named after the Luigi main Vudujin

        <br>This technique can be used to stall for time(though this purpose is generally banned at tournaments),

    <string name="waveshine_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Waveshine</b></big>
        <br>A waveshine is a wavedash done immediately out of a shine.
        It can be done by Fox and Falco, and requires a very high level of tech skill as
        it is very demanding to implement it into your game.
        <br>Waveshining is also a popular mixup when pillaring an opponent\'s shield. The waveshine allows the
        Falco player to move behind an opponent\'s shield to not get shieldgrabbed.
        <br>For both Fox and Falco, the waveshine can be used as a method of spacing and avoiding the lag after
        a shine.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to waveshine</b></big>
        <br>A wavedash can be performed anytime a character is on the ground and can jump. The shine can be canceled by jumping
        shortly after it is initiated. This is known as jump canceling.
        To waveshine, use the shine, then jump cancel into a wavedash out of it.
        <br>It is often easier to use the X/Y buttons instead of the control stick because it is considered harder to wavedash
        with only the control stick. The logic is that to jump with the control stick requires the stick to go up. To wavedash,
        the succeeding angle is angled towards the ground. This makes for more complicated manual motions, and should be avoided
        in order to achieve a speedy waveshine.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Users of the waveshine</b></big>
        <br>
        <br><b>Fox</b>
        <br>The waveshine is generally used for combos with Fox. However, some characters fall over when shined. This
        presents a problem, and generally these characters are immune to waveshine combos. Note that if these
        characters crouch-cancel the shine, they will not fall over and can be treated as normal waveshine. Also,
        using an attack after the wavedash can cause a character who has fallen over to be \"forced\" to stand up
        (a jab reset). This is referred to as \"Thunder\'s Combo.\"
        <br>A waveshine can be followed up by many attacks. The choice of attacks depends on how far the opponent is
        pushed away. For example, Peach is not pushed away very far at all, but Luigi is pushed very far away. As
        such, Fox\'s choice of move following a waveshine against Luigi is more limited.
        <br>Some of the most useful attacks used in conjunction are the up smash, grab, down aerial, or even another
        shine. Waveshining plays a vital part in Fox\'s infinite combo.
        <br>
        <br><b>Falco</b>
        <br>The waveshine is generally used to aid in Falco\'s vertical down aerial and shine combos. It gives Falco
        the added horizontal distance such that he can jump up and catch up with his opponent. This is especially
        useful against a DIing Fox. A waveshine followed by another wavedash makes Falco a combo machine.

    <string name="wobbling_info_text"><![CDATA[Examples of wobbling: http://oddshot.tv/shot/dreamhacksmash-2015092012552578/
        <br>http://gfycat.com/InbornObeseIbizanhound
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Wobbling</b></big>
        <br>Wobbling is an infinite grab technique exclusive to the Ice Climbers.
        When performed with the right timing, opponents cannot break out of Popo\'s grab
        and will continuously get hit; the technique can also be performed on all characters in the game except
        against another pair of Ice Climbers.
        <br>Wobbling received its name as a reference to American smasher and Ice Climbers main Wobbles; the term was
        reportedly first used by spectators after he claimed 9th place in NCT2 with considerable use of the technique.
        <br>In addition to standard Wobbling, a variation called Blizzobbling can also be performed, where Nana instead
        uses Blizzard to attack opponents instead of using a tilt. Like Wobbling, it is also inescapable.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>Here is a slightly more in-depth description on how to do it from Wobbles, note that if your opponent is
        less than 30&#37; they can struggle out of the grab.
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Grab.
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Make sure Nana, your secondary IC, is close to you.
        <br><b>Step 3:</b> Hit A to have Popo headbutt; Nana will jab.
        <br><b>Step 4:</b> Gently slide the joystick either forward or down so that when you hit A next, Nana will tilt.
        Make sure she does the tilt before the headbutt ends.
        <br><b>Step 5:</b> As you continue sliding the joystick to its maximum, press A rhythmically. You want your attacks to
        be spaced apart as evenly as possible.
        <br><b>Step 6:</b> Keep pressing A with the joystick held in the direction you\'ve chosen. You don\'t have to move the
        joystick any more after this. Just keep it held to do the tilt you\'ve chosen.
        <br><b>Step 7:</b> When you are done, discard the opponent. I recommend waiting until Popo headbutts then hitting the
        c-stick down. Your down-smash will come out fastest and your opponent will have no forewarning that you\'re
        going to hit them; if there is anything to tech off of, they won\'t be able to. They also may DI poorly, but
        odds are you will continue hitting them until DI no longer matters.
        <br>If you have trouble wobbling, check this video: https://youtu.be/QciuRXj5Q8E
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</b></big>
        <br>Wobbling works by the existence of a mechanics exploit in Melee. When an opponent is grabbed, they cannot mash
        out of the grab if the character grabbing them is performing an attack. This is the basis behind how pummeling
        works; opponents cannot mash out when a pummel connects, but pummels are not fast enough to stop them from
        escaping in-between them. However, Popo and Nana are treated as the same character when attacking. Thus, players
        can exploit desynching to force them to attack in an alternating manner that does not allow enough time for any
        character to escape from the grab; the delay between the pummel and the tilt is minuscule if not nonexistent,
        and is humanly impossible to escape from.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Yo-yo glitch</b></big>
        <br>The yo-yo glitch refers to a glitch done using Ness\'s
        yo-yo. It can be used to attack or grab with near limitless range or attach certain single-hitbox attacks to
        Ness\'s body. The discovery of the glitch was a collaborative effort between VilNess, LonelyNess, and Dan
        Smith, and was spurred on by an innocuous video of an unknown Japanese player accidentally dropping a yo-yo hitbox.
        <br>The glitch can be performed in all versions of Melee.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Mechanics</b></big>
        <br>Ness\'s up smash consists of 3 parts each with its own hitbox: outreaching, spinning, and swinging. The
        yo-yo glitch drops the last hitbox of the up smash onto the ground and leaves it there until Ness gets KO
        \'d or uses a non-projectile attack.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>Use Ness\'s up smash and hit any opponent or destructible part of the stage with the outreaching part
        of the yo-yo. Charge the yo-yo very slightly before releasing.
        <br>Make sure that, after the yo-yo is released into its upward swing, it doesn\'t hit anything else.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Thunder Jacket</b></big>
        <br>A follow-up technique to the Yoyo Glitch discovered by Simna ibn Sind.
        <br><b>Instructions:</b>
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Perform the Yoyo Glitch.
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Use PK Thunder to floorblast yourself from the air or use PK Thunder to hit yourself into a ledge and grab it.
        <br><b>Effects:</b>
        <br>Attaches the hitbox of PK Thunder (Ness\' recovery attack) to Ness\' body.
        <br>Blocks most attacks that it collides with and hurts opponents and destructible stages.

    <string name="aerialinterrupt_info_text"><![CDATA[<b>Note:</b> This technique
        cannot be performed in as many ways with DK, Jigglypuff or Kirby, as their ECB
        (Environmental Collision Box, the \"bones\" of the player model) is fixed and does not change orientation during attacks.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Aerial Interrupt</b></big>
        <br>Often abbreviated as AI, this technique can be used to quickly land onto platforms or to quickly land from
        a ledge hop with extra intangible frames. There are usually more options to AI when compared to no-impact landing, but AI comes
        with 3 more frames of landing lag. The main difference between an AI and a platform cancel is that AI implies the player used the aerial
        while their character got onto the platform. While platform canceling has the player stay on top of the platform, has much more strict
        timing, and requires some sort of hitstun to occur.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</b></big>
        <br>This technique uses a similar property as the no-impact landing, where the characters ECB is
        changed during a certain action to that it is placed right above a platform when the characters downward
        velocity is very low, but instead of only jumping, this technique uses an attack to change the ECB\'s
        orientation and size so that the ECB would be placed slightly above the platform the character wishes to
        land on.
        <br>An aerial interrupt has 4 frames (or as many auto cancel frames the aerial has)
         of landing lag compared to the 1 frame of landing lag of a no-impact landing,
        this is because the aerial attacks used for this technique are canceled in their auto cancelable moments. Meaning
        there is less landing lag, and no L-canceling is needed.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>While most characters have an aerial interrupt, some have different timing and move usages.
        <br>As the information is quite extensive, look online for each of the different aerials each
        character can use.
        <br>Once you know which moves you can use, select the character and attempt to jump onto any platform
        using any aerial attack that works, and make sure the moment where the characters ECB is oriented
        in order to AI properly is performed with proper timing so it is placed right above the platform you wish to
        land on and you are at the apex of your jump. You should then land and experience very little landing lag.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Other types of AI</b></big>
        <br>
        <br><b>Aerial Interrupt Attack</b>
        <br>Abbreviated as AIA, this is practically a AI with a hitbox. This is performed almost exactly the same as an AI, but
        the move that is used does not have it\'s ECB align properly to AI until the moves hitbox comes out, one example is Dr. Mario\'s
        uair, since the attack has Dr. turn upside down on the second frame of the hitbox, his ECB is adjusted at that position and time
        and he can AI with a hitbox coming out. Unlike AI, it is required to L-cancel an AIA to properly perform it. This can be used to
        punish extremely quickly, and to lead to more follow ups. Characters like Mario, Dr. Mario
        <br>
        <br><b>Instant AI</b>
        <br>Performed by doing a normal AI, except that you are taking advantage of the ability to extend the ECB of your character
        downward with certain moves, so that you land on the first frame of the move performed, rather than a frame after 1.
        <br>
        <br><b>Lifting AI</b>
        <br>Similar to instant AI, except you\'re using an aerial that moves your ECB upwards, higher than your character is, so it
        would reach it\'s position as if you were normally AI, and seemingly lift you (albeit slightly) to whatever platform you\'re
        attempting to AI onto. One quick way to perform this is to try to shorthop onto the middle platform from the left or right one
        on Yoshi\'s Story as Falco, and dair at the point where Falco reaches the apex of his jump. The dair will move Falco\'s
        ECB upwards, just enough to AI onto the top play form.

    <string name="chaing_info_text" formatted="false"><![CDATA[<big><b>Chain grab</b></big>
        <br>Chain grabs, also referred to as a chain throw or abbreviated as CG, refers to a series
        of grabs and throws that the victim cannot escape. Generally, a player throws the opponent
        a specific direction (most commonly down or forward), chases the opponents directional influence,
        and grabs the opponent while they are still in midair and before they can tech. Sheik and the Ice
        Climbers are examples of characters who rely heavily on chain grabs. Generally, fastfallers,
        heavyweights, and large characters tend to be more vulnerable to chain grabs than floaty characters,
        lightweights, and smaller characters. Some circumstances can enable a chain grab to be a zero-to-death
        combo. The Ice Climbers are particularly potent at this.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Characters who can chain grab</b></big>
        <br>
        <br><b>Note:</b> Don\'t take these too seriously, all chain grabs depend largely on weight, percent, and DI.
        <br>
        <br><b>Sheik:</b> can chain most characters (Bowser, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Pikachu, Ganondorf, Pichu, Roy, Young Link,
        Mr. Game &amp; Watch, Link, Ness, and Sheik) with her down throw from as little as 0&#37; up to as high as 90&#37;. On
        other characters it can reliably tech chase to high percents. This however doesn\'t work in the PAL version
        of Melee due to her down throw sending her opponents too far forward to grab again.
        <br>
        <br><b>Marth and Roy:</b> Marth and Roy\'s up throw can chain throw Fox and Falco from 0&#37; to about 90&#37;. However, Roy
        has to turn to chain throw upward but Marth doesn\'t have to always turn to chain throw upward.
        <br>
        <br><b>Ice Climbers:</b> Against the
        Fast fallers and Roy, Popo can down throw while Nana immediately uses a down air them to force the players
        opponent to land standing up, where they are easily grabbed again. Even without Nana, Popo by himself can
        chain throw a handful of characters, such as Roy, Sheik, and Ganondorf with down throw until about 50&#37;.
        <br>
        <br><b>Peach:</b> can chain throw fast fallers, floaty characters, and heavyweight at high percentage with her down throw. She
        can also chain grab with her up throw against everyone at 0&#37; and fast fallers at 40&#37;.
        <br>
        <br><b>Captain Falcon:</b> can pseudo chain throw with down throw against Marth, Sheik, and Roy from 0&#37; to about 20&#37;. It can
        easily be escaped with good DI. Up throw can also chain throw Fox/Falco/Falcon from about 50&#37; to about 80&#37;
        if they don\'t DI away.
        <br>
        <br><b>Ganondorf</b>: can chain throw a variety of characters with his down and up throws. Up throw works similar to Captain
        Falcon\'s, but at lower percentages. Down throw can chain throw characters with moderate falling speeds
        (such as Pikachu and Link) at low percentages and chain throws fast-fallers at high percentages.
        <br>
        <br><b>Luigi</b>: can chain throw Fox, Falco, Ganondorf (from 0&#37; to about 30&#37;) and Falcon with up throws and can chain throw
        Bowser, Ganondorf and Sheik with down throws at 30&#37;.
        <br>
        <br><b>Peach, Pikachu, Pichu, Mewtwo, Fox, Mario, Dr. Mario, Marth, Roy, Donkey Kong, and Mr. Game &amp; Watch:</b> can chain throw
        Fox, Falco, and Captain Falcon with up throws, and at 100&#37; Mr. Game &amp; Watch, and (at 150&#37;) Mario, Doctor Mario can chain
        throw the fast falling characters with down throws. Marth and Roy cannot chain throw Captain Falcon.
        <br>
        <br><b>Link:</b> can pseudo chain throw opponents at very low percentages with his forward throw, however it is easy to DI out of.
        <br>
        <br><b>Falco:</b> can pseudo chain throw Fox at any percent with down throw. Its far from inescapable, however, since Fox can
        Shine or Jab to interrupt Falco, and Falco can chain throw anyone with his back throw.
        <br>
        <br><b>Mewtwo:</b> can chain throw with its downthrow on large characters like Bowser from 0-50&#37;. Mewtwo can also chain throw
        fast fallers like Fox, Falco, Sheik, Captain Falcon and sometimes Roy, giving him an advantage against
        these characters. Ganondorf and DK are also vulnerable to its chain grab, but Mewtwo needs to run and
        then grab to be able to grab again (though Ganondorf is easier to chain grab than DK)
        <br>
        <br><b>Donkey Kong:</b> can chain throw Fox, Falco and Falcon with the up throw at low to mid percentages. Donkey Kong can
        also chain throw Fox, Falco, and Captain Falcon with forward throw, then while carrying them, up throw.]]>

        cause you to get \"sucked\" in, and take more damage. Keep in mind sometimes CC is not very effective after

    <string name="ddance_info_text"><![CDATA[Example of dash dancing: https://youtu.be/mk09c6iLLdU
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Dash-dance</b></big>
        <br>This is an advanced technique performed by rapidly tapping
        the analog stick left and right while on the ground, it cancels out the characters initial dashing
        animation with another animation in the opposite direction, causing the character to quickly and
        repeatedly dash to the right and left in a short distance.
        <br>In the video above, KJH performs a well done dash-dance to trick Armada into keeping his shield up,
        believing that KJH may attack him from the dash-dance.
        <br>
        <br>The maximum time a character can dash in one direction and still change direction by dash dancing is the
        same as the number of frames in their initial dash animation. After this animation is over, the
        character will enter their regular dashing animation; at this point, tapping the analog stick in
        the opposite direction will cause the character to enter their turnaround animation, during which
        no attacks can be performed.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>In competitive play</b></big>
        <br>An application of dash-dancing in competitive Melee; S2J, as Captain Falcon, constantly uses
        dash-dances in order to quickly pursue Fox out of Falcon\'s throws, allowing for tech-chasing.
        <br>While dash-dancing can be performed in all four games, it derives most of its use in Melee.
        <br>In Melee, dash dancing is used primarily to play spacing mindgames with the opponent. By
        continuously switching directions, the player can confuse opponents in regards to their approach,
        as they can potentially either backtrack or approach while dash-dancing; in addition, it can also
        cause opponents to attempt an attack in the dash-forward animation, only for the player to dash
        backwards and quickly punish the end lag of such attacks by doubling-back. As players can also
        jump out of a dash-dance, it can allow players to quickly use SHFFLs and wavedashes. Dash-dancing
        can also be used in conjunction with low-knockback throws to perform tech-chases, as the action
        allows players to quickly run in either direction, allowing for quick pursuit of rolling opponents.
        Characters with fast dashing animations, such as Fox, Marth, and Captain Falcon, make the most
        use of the technique, and proper use of dash-dancing is important in all of their respective
        metagames.

    ]]></string>
    <string name="di_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Directional influence</b></big>
        <br>Often abbreviated as DI, this is the control the receiver of an attack
        has over his or her trajectory. Each attack sends its target in a particular direction, depending on the
        attack itself and on the target\'s weight and falling speed; DI can be used to alter, but not completely change,
        this original trajectory. This change can be vital to surviving high-power attacks such as Fox\'s up smash, and
        for escaping combos such as Jigglypuff\'s up-throw to rest combo on fast-fallers (see the space animal slayer).
        Perhaps one of DI\'s most useful applications is the ability to make the character move in a path that is as
        long as possible before crossing the blast line.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to properly DI</b></big>
        <br>To make sure you DI well you have to anticipate what move your opponent is going to land on you
        and DI in a way that\'ll save you. If a Falco dairs you, DI towards the stage so you\'ll go into
        the stage and be able to tech, rather than get spiked past the stage and die. Another example is if a Fox
        side smashes you, to DI whichever way extends the distance traveled to reach the side blastzones. As his
        side smash is usually a NE/NW angle, it\'s best if you DI upwards so the arch you travel needs to cover more
        distance to reach the blastzone.
        <br>"Good DI" usually occurs when a character is sent in a
        trajectory that creates the greatest distance between the character and the blast line. In most situations,
        angling towards the upper-left or upper-right corners will grant the greatest chance of surviving a
        high-knockback attack.
        <br>Conversely, \"poor DI\" occurs when the shortest distance between the character
        and the blastzone is created, or the angle sends the player into a position they cannot recover from
        when they would normally easily recover from, such as down and away from the stage. Bad DI that results
        in a death commonly occurs near the sides of the stage, when a character is hit diagonally while holding
        the Control Stick downward (commonly as a result of intentional fastfalling), which sends them on a more
        horizontal trajectory, towards the closest blast line.
        <br>The player can DI by pressing the control stick in any direction during or just after being hit by an attack.
        There are three types of directional influence: trajectory DI (almost always referred to as just \"DI\"),
        Smash DI, and Automatic Smash DI. These last two function much differently from trajectory DI, and
        should not be confused with it.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Types of DI</b></big>
        <br>
        <br><b>Survival DI</b>
        <br>Survival DI alters the knockback direction towards the upper corners of the screen so that blast zones
        are escaped, preventing a kill provided that the knockback wasn\'t too high.
        <br>
        <br><b>Combo DI</b>
        <br>Because of the high amount of hitstun in Melee compared to Brawl (or, more accurately, the lack of the ability
        to negate hitstun), it is often possible to hit the opponent with another attack while they are still in hitstun.
        By DIing away from the attacker, the victim can increase the distance the attacker needs to travel and thus make
        it harder for the attacker to reach them in time to continue the combo.
        <br>Most of the time, combo DI is as simple as holding left or right in the knockback direction. Against characters
        like Captain Falcon who have aerials with high knockback and low ending lag, it is often hard to decide between
        survival DI and combo DI. While combo DI might escape a consecutive hit, it might also be enough to pass the
        horizontal blast zones and die. Survival DI ensures that doesn\'t happen, but it will make it easy for Captain
        Falcon to land another aerial.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Mechanics</b></big>
        <br>To determine the effective trajectory, the position of the control stick is read on the last frame of hitlag.
        ASDI is usually triggered by this as well. The highest deviation of trajectory is produced by directions
        perpendicular to the original knockback angle of the hitbox and amounts to approximately 18°. Holding directions
        that are parallel to the original angle will produce no survival DI at all. Because the possible DI angles are
        not distributed equally (see diagram in DI Angles), knockback angles within 17° of vertical or horizontal can
        be trajectory DI\'d to a lesser degree, as no true correspondent perpendicular angle is available.

    <string name="ffall_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Fast falling</b></big>
        <br>Fast falling is the act of falling quicker than usual in mid-air.
        <br>It is performed by tapping down on the control stick while falling. The character will continue
        to fast fall until landing on the platform or taking a hit. Gravity is ignored once a fast fall
        is begun; the character\'s downward velocity is simply set to their fast falling speed without
        accelerating. Fast falling is a technique commonly used to speed up a character\'s game, especially
        after a short hop. It is a part of SHFFL\'ing, an advanced technique.
        <br>Stall-then-fall aerials have an effect similar to fastfalling, though the move is an attack,
        and most of the time cannot be stopped or slowed.
        <br>If players press down while hanging from a ledge, their character will begin to fast fall,
        whereas if pressed in the opposite direction of the ledge, the character will merely let go
        of the ledge. This also works with down + B attacks, except for ones that slow down falling
        or gain height. (An example is Fox\'s Reflector or Luigi\'s Luigi Cyclone.)

    <string name="ftrot_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Fox-trot</b></big>
        <br>Fox-trotting is the technique that consists of moving along the
        ground by repeatedly executing characters\' initial dash animation, as opposed to using their
        full dash. Since some characters\' initial dash animations move them faster than their full dash,
        these characters are able to run faster with the use of fox-trotting. Fox trotting is predominately
        used in Super Smash Bros. Melee, and characters with which the technique is most commonly executed
        are Fox, Captain Falcon, Roy, and Marth.
        <br>One way of performing a fox-trot is by flicking or tapping the control stick sideways to perform
        an initial dash, returning the stick to a neutral position to cancel the onset of the full dash,
        and then tapping the stick sideways again to perform another initial dash. This sequence can be
        repeated to move the character along the ground, and the timing of each character\'s fox-trot is
        different.
        <br>Fox-trotting can also be performed by jump-canceling a dash into a
        wavedash, then dashing again, or by dash-canceling a full dash into another dash.

    <string name="jabreset_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Jab reset</b></big>
        <br>A jab reset is a technique that is performed
        by jabbing an opponent while they are knocked down. The jab will force the opponent to get up, where
        the opponent can then hit them with almost any move they desire, which is usually utilised to land a
        KO move.
        <br>This only works with extremely weak set knockback attacks, or attacks with extremely low base
        knockback at very low percentages, such as the first hit in most jabs, or Falco\'s laser.
        This is because higher knockback attacks will force the opponent into knockback. Unlike a
        normal getup from knockdown, a jab reset induced getup does not have any invincibility frames.
        Jab resets can also be used to continue a combo on an opponent even after a knockdown.
        <br>
        <br>To be detailed, the attack needs to do less than 7&#37; damage and knockback has to be
        less than 13 frames in order to cause a forced get up.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</b></big>
        <br>If you are hit by an attack that does less than 7.00&#37; while in the DownBound
        (bounce when you 1st hit the ground without teching) or DownWait (after the bounce when
        laying on the ground) actions you go into the DownDamage action during the knockback.
        This animation is 13 frames long.
        <br>If DownDamage ends while in the air you change actions to Fall (also canceling out
        any remaining hitstun you may have had), and you can jump/do whatever out of it or
        simply land on your feet if you touch the ground. This is very apparent on things like
        using a stale raptor boost or stale shine with Falco on a downed character, since the
        KB is powerful enough to send them far but is still able to do less than 7 dmg.
        They go flying upwards while in the fall animation and without hitstun.
        <br>A/S/DI upwards will help you get higher from the knockback and can be used
        to keep you in the air long enough for the animation to complete before landing
        and escape a reset. For whatever reason, you are allowed to A/S/DI non-tumble KBs
        with angles 0° or lower normally while in DownDamage. You normally can\'t A/SDI
        vertically or use any form of trajectory DI on them when on the ground.
        <br>If DownDamage ends while on the ground, however, you change actions to DownWait
        if you were still in hitstun or directly into DownStand if you were not.
        The former is what I would call an Option Tap Reset, and the latter an
        Optionless Tap Reset. If you are in DownWait you are forced to get up when
        hitstun ends, but you are also able to interrupt the animation with either a
        getup stand/roll/attack at any time before then.
        <br>
        <br>For example, Fox\'s shine, Falco\'s laser, and Peach\'s jab 1 all have no
        knockback growth. The shine\'s KB is strong enough to stun all characters for
        13+ frames, and so a reset will always be an OTR on all characters. The laser
        causes 12 or less stun on all characters and so the reset is always an OLTR.
        The jab causes 13+ stun for everyone that is Falco\'s weight or lighter and is
        an OTR on them, but 12 or less on everyone heavier and is an OLTR on those
        characters. For ones with KBG, Sheik\'s jab 1 and needles are an OLTR until
        they\'re around 40 or so depending on weight, and Jiggs\' jab 1 is an OLTR
        until near 100.

    <string name="jcgrab_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Jump-canceled grab</b></big>
        <br>A jump-canceled grab (abbreviated as "JC grab") is a way of grabbing your opponent
        that usually functions better than a dash grab. JC grabs usually have less startup and
        cooldown lag compared to the normal dash grab and also usually have slightly larger
        hitboxes than standard grab (though still smaller than actual dash-garb). When you
        do a JC grab the character performs the standing grab animation while sliding
        forward slightly (depending on traction). Fox and Falco can also perform it out
        of their shine (Shine-grabbing).
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>In order to perform a JC grab you must jump with Up, X or Y and then immediately
        click Z to cancel the jump with your grab. It can be performed standing still or while dashing,
        the latter being the preferred form of usage.

    <string name="lcancel_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>L-canceling</b></big>
        <br>Part of SHFFL, this is a technique that allows characters to act faster than usual when landing in the middle
        of an aerial attack. L-canceling is done
        by pressing the shield button 1 to 7 frames before landing in Melee.
        <br>Only regular aerial attacks can be L-canceled; special moves that have landing lag cannot. If an
        attack is auto-canceled then L-canceling has no effect. All aerials can be canceled except
        Mr. Game &amp; Watch\'s nair, bair and uair.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Performing</b></big>
        <br>L-canceling in Melee is performed by pressing L, R or Z up to 7 frames before landing.
        Doing so causes the aerial attacks landing animation to play at double speed, cutting the
        lag time in half (rounded down). The decrease in lag is  significant enough to
        make L-canceled aerial attacks better than comparable
        ground attacks. This is especially true for characters with heavier aerial landing lag,
        most notably Bowser and Ganondorf. L-canceling in Melee can be performed
        only when L, R or Z are pressed once during the activation period, otherwise the effect will be canceled.

    <string name="ledgecancel_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Ledge-canceling</b></big>
        <br>This technique also known as edge canceling) allows players to end the
        landing lag from an aerial attack (and some special
        moves) by sliding into their teetering animation after landing or by sliding off of the stage or
        platform entirely. Ledge-canceling moves grants players both opportunities for more movement options
        and for extremely fast followups using attacks that do not normally have combo potential. While all
        aerial attacks can be ledge-canceled, not all aerial special attacks can be. Attempting to cancel
        one of these specials will usually result in the character remaining on the stage for the rest of
        the lag of the attack. Some special moves, like Link\'s Spin Attack can be ledge-canceled without
        ever leaving the ground simply by running at the edge and performing the special move with good timing.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Performing the technique</b></big>
        <br>Ledge-canceling, while fairly simple in concept, can be difficult to perform (especially while using
        characters with high traction) due to the tight spacing it requires relative to the ledge of the stage
        or platform. Players must put out an attack in the air while moving toward the edge of the stage, with
        spacing such that after landing they will continue to slide and eventually reach the edge.
        <br>In essence, the character briefly touches the \"corner\" of the ground, with the transition from air-to-ground-to-air
        (or air-to-ground-to-teeter) canceling the remainder of the move. When ledge-canceling to combo, players
        will often try to perform the first move as close to the ground as possible while still giving it time
        to produce a hitbox.
        <br>This results in the minimum number of frames separating the first and second hits,
        making more followups possible. When set up properly, players will immediately slide to the ledge,
        removing all lag after the first hit and allowing for an instant followup (save for the minimum of
        three frames it takes to land, slide to the edge, and be able to put out another attack).
        <br>
        <br>Different results can be obtained when ledge canceling from the air, based on factors such as speed,
        held direction, and the direction that the character is facing during the ledge-cancel. If facing the
        edge the character will enter free fall if the player is holding forward or if the character has too
        much momentum to stop from the teeter. Otherwise, when the character is moving sufficiently slowly and
        forward is not held, they will simply remain in their teetering animation. When facing away from the
        edge, the character will enter free fall and sometimes be able grab the edge of the stage, depending
        on attributes such as falling speed. Remaining on stage after a ledge-cancel is more difficult than
        sliding off of it, and it grants the player access to any moves they can use while grounded instead
        of moves that can be performed while in the air.

        <br><big><b>Ledgedash</b></big>
        <br>Ledgedashing is a technique where one takes advantage of the 29 frames of invincibility
        that occurs upon dropping from the ledge and uses several other advanced techniques (such
        as wavedash) to get back onto the stage and gain control in an otherwise
        disadvantageous position.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</b></big>
        <br>When a character grabs onto a ledge, after 7 frames (3 for Link) they enter the
        CliffWait animation. At this point is when the character can perform all their ledge options.
        and gain 29 frames of invincibility free to use.
        This is when you have the choice to ledgestall, ledgedash, or just approach with any other option.
        Ledgedashing involves the character double jumping, wavelanding onto the stage, and using any
        other extra frames to their advantage. This technique requires perfect inputs to be performed correctly.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform a ledgedash, hang on a ledge, and drop down on the first frame available, then double jump,
        and either waveland onto the land that you were hanging onto or to the platform above you. (although
        the latter may not work for all characters, it does work for most of the fast characters such as Fox,
        Falco, and Falcon) If performed correctly, your character will arrive on top of the stage, and would have
        been invincible for a good chunk of the ledgedash. This technique is good to use to get out of a sticky spot.

    <string name="ledgestall_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Ledgestall</b></big>
        <br>Ledgestalling allows a character to refresh the ledge intangibility
        infinitely. There are three different ways to do this, not all of them work with every character.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Explanation</b></big>
        <br>As soon as a character grabs the ledge, he goes into the CliffCatch animation that lasts 7 frames
        (3 for Link) and has complete intangibility that lasts 30 frames longer than the CliffCatch animation.
        On the last frame of CliffCatch, the player can perform all ledge options except letting go (ledge attack,
        ledge roll, ledge climb, ledge jump). If the player doesn\'t perform any of these, he/she enters the CliffWait
        animation during which he/she can also let go of the ledge. The player now has 29 frames of intangibility left
        that he/she can use freely. As soon as Link drops from the ledge, the Disabled Regrab Period countdown-timer
        starts at 29. Thus, maintaining continuous invincibility requires dropping from the ledge on the first
        frame it is possible – otherwise, there would be at least one frame without intangibility on which the
        DRP timer was still active. Exceptions from this rule are Sheik’s and Mewtwo’s Up-B ledgestalls – their
        up special moves have intangibility early on so they don’t depend on the ledge intangibility as much.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Up-B ledgestall</b></big>
        <br>Up-B ledgestall
        <br>Zelda, Sheik, Fox, Falco, Mewtwo and Pikachu (possibly others as well?) can ledgestall with their up
        specials. Sheik\'s \"Shino Stall\", named after Japanese Sheik player Shino, is by far the easiest and
        most useful as her up special has innate intangibility, a strong hitbox and many movement options.
        <br>
        <br><b>How to perform</b>
        <br>This technique can be performed by putting the control stick back, so you ledge drop, then jumping and
        using your Up-B right when you\'re at the ledge.
        <br>For Fox and Falco it is possible to skip jumping and just Up-B if you do the proper timing.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Ledgehopstall</b></big>
        <br>This ledgestall is only possible with Captain Falcon, Ganondorf, Link, Roy and Bowser. (While
        it is possible to do with most characters, it\'ll take longer than 29 frames so they would no longer be intangible.)
        <br>By dropping from the ledge and immediately holding down to fastfall, these characters can abuse
        their high falling acceleration and low second jump height to reach the ledge and start falling
        again within 29 frames after having dropped from the ledge.
        <br>
        <br>It’s also possible to jump immediately after dropping from the ledge and fastfall after the peak of
        the jump. This is considered technically harder because holding down too long will prevent the ledgegrab.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Ledgedashstall (Haxdash)</b></big>
        <br>Rarely used competitively because of the high amount of precision necessary and the risk of losing
        the stock if even one input is slightly off. Hax is one of the few players who have shown mastery of
        this technique and coined the alternate term Haxdash.
        <br>By letting go of the ledge, jumping towards it and wavelanding away from it, the ledgegrab box
        overlaps the ledge again just when the ledge intangibility has ended for most of the cast. Some characters,
        like Marth, need to fastfall in order to get down far enough in time before the intangibility has run
        out while others, like Captain Falcon need to waste a few frames so they don\'t fall below the
        stage before the intangibility ends.

        be sliding along it (this is important), and so that you catch the ledge again as soon as possible in your double
        jump (thus you have to double jump at a certain height, and you have to take the risk to double jump too low and miss the edge)
        <br>While grabbing the ledge, smash away with the control stick (It isn\'t always necessary but if you don\'t do it, it might not work).
        <br>Then, you\'re ready to ledge wall jump : you have to smash the stick away in 1 frame to wall jump (if not, it\'ll start

        are touching the wall on the way to the ledge.

    <string name="moonwalk_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Moonwalk</b></big>
        <br>This is a technique that involves
        sliding backwards during in the initial dash animation. Discovered by the smasher Mr.C, the technique
        is named after the signature dance move of famed pop singer Michael Jackson.
        <br>
        <br>Example of moonwalk: https://youtu.be/D_xDJM3jOYg
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Performing the moonwalk</b></big>
        <br>Moonwalking is achieved by tilting the control stick backwards while dashing, but without passing
        through the neutral position. The only easy way to do this is to rotate the stick below the neutral
        position (as going above results in a jump), but just barely below as to prevent losing some distance
        from crouching; as a result, the player needs to turn the stick so that it forms a semielliptical
        shape instead of a semicircular shape. This should result in the user doing a backwards slide, but
        in a state more similar to dashing than to wavedashing.
        <br>Alternatively, its possible to moonwalk by very quickly smashing the control stick backwards after
        the first frame of a dash, fast enough that the game doesn\'t detect the stick in the neutral position.
        This variation yields slightly longer moonwalks and is thus considered a perfect moonwalk, but the
        sub-frame precision required is exceptionally difficult, and so outside of TAS scenarios it is never
        seen in practice.
        <br>All characters in the game can moonwalk, though some might require the use of the Bunny Hood before
        a noticeable effect can be seen. A majority of characters, however, require an extra step; they need
        to start from a walk (specifically not a run) in the direction opposite the way the character faces
        during the slide.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Moonwalking distance</b></big>
        <br>The moonwalk is most noticeable when used by Captain Falcon, though some other characters, like Link and Mewtwo,
        also have rather noticeable moonwalks. The following characters can moonwalk without needing to
        walk in the opposite direction, ranked by distance:

        <br>The moonwalk acts as a generally situational technique in the competitive metagame, owing to the
        greater prevalence of wavedashing. In most cases, the moonwalk is primarily used for extra flash by the smasher.
        Moonwalking, however, is not a completely useless technique. The technique can be used in mindgames in
        order to mix up movement or otherwise bait opponents, adding a degree of unpredictability to a smashers
        playstyle. Cautious smashers can also attempt to use the moonwalk as to more efficiently edgehog instead
        of using a wavedash.
        <br>In addition, by principle, the moonwalk allows characters to slide backwards while the game recognizes
        them as standing; as such, smashers can perform techniques similar to wavesmashing and wavegrabbing with
        the technique, provided their character has a sufficiently long moonwalk.
        Due to his powerful edgeguarding game and long moonwalk, Captain Falcon derives the most applications
        from moonwalking, as the backward momentum from moonwalking can allow him to slide off the stage in order
        to intercept recovering opponents with an aerial attack. In some cases, this can actually act as a superior
        alternative to going offstage with other techniques, as the moonwalk can move Captain Falcon much farther
        offstage and will also allow Falcon to retain his double jump, allowing for safer recovery.

    <string name="noimpact_info_text"><![CDATA[<b>Note:</b> This technique cannot be performed in as many ways with DK, Jigglypuff or Kirby, as their ECB
        (Environmental Collision Box, the \"bones\" of the player model) is fixed and does not change orientation during jumps.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>No-impact landing</b></big>
        <br>Often abbreviated as NIL, no-impact landing occurs when a character lands on any platform at the apex of their jump.
        The no-impact land is lagless and lacks the 4 frame crouch animation that typically occurs after landing from the
        air. This allows characters to immediately attack, shield, etc. from the platform.
        <br>Due to Ganondorf\'s doublejump height, he can easily do invincible attacks from the ledge. If done perfectly,
        there are 8 frames of invincibility to work with, so jab and grab can both be done with full invincibility.
        If they\'re trying to space on the ledge, ftilt can also catch them, although you will become vulnerable on the
        frame that the hitbox comes out which could result in a trade. NIL Jab is a good option since it has decent
        range for a jab, has a 5 frame margin of error, and is just a generally good \"get outta here\" move.
        <br>Every character can do no impact lands. It\'s very easy to see the technique demonstrated if you take Falco
        to battlefield and fullhop to the top platform since the top platform is exactly the same as his fullhop height.
        <br>Floaty characters are the easiest to do No Impact Lands with since they hover at the apex of their jump for a
        longer time.
        <br>This technique can allow quick follows up, and fast punishes to opponents not expecting the rapid landing.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</b></big>
        <br>When a character jumps, and they their ECB ends up just slightly above the platform for a frame
        when their velocity is very little, the character
        will immediately land, experiencing only 1 frame of landing lag, rather than the extra time needed to fall back down
        onto the platform, and the 4 frames of landing lag that occur when you land normally.
        <br>It can be performed from the ledge for some characters (and provide a few frames of extra invincibility from
        ledge hoping or can be performed onto a pass through platform, such as the platforms in Battlefield or Yoshi\'s
        Story.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform this technique, jump in whatever way allows the jump to reach it\'s apex (the highest point),
        right above the platform. Easy ways to witness a no-impact landing are to full hop with Falco onto the top platform
        in Battlefield, and to hop backwards with Falcon onto the top platform in Yoshi\'s Story.

    <string name="platformcancel_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Platform canceling</b></big>
        <br>While dropping down from a platform - one frame after the initial crouch animation - characters
        are considered to be in the air. Because of this, they are obviously allowed to use aerial attacks.
        Platform canceling takes its name from the fact that using an aerial attack during that one frame causes
        the character to re-land on the platform, thus canceling the platform.
        <br>Platform cancels depends on many things. How fast the hitbox comes out, the strength of the attack
        (which in turn affects how much hitlag there is), the fall speed of the character, and the ECB pattern
        of the attack. The two most important ones are speed and strength.
        <br>The main difference between an AI and a platform cancel is that platform canceling has the player stay
        on top of the platform, and has much more strict timing. It also requires the hitlag from landing the aerial
        you are platform canceling.
        While an AI implies the player used the aerial while their character got onto the platform.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>Drop through a platform that the character is standing on.
        Exactly one frame afterwards, use any aerial attack, land it on an opponent, and L-cancel.
        <br>If done correctly, a platform cancel will occur, your character would\'ve performed an
        aerial (and landed it) all while staying on top of the platform.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Applicable attacks in Melee</b></big>
        <br>Unless noted, attacks have a one frame window. These apply to stationary platforms;
        for downward moving platforms, the window sizes may vary, and more attacks may be possible.
        <br>
        <br>\t<b>Link</b> – nair (two frame window), uair
        <br>\t<b>Luigi</b> – nair (two frame window), bair
        <br>\t<b>Mario</b> – nair
        <br>\t<b>Marth</b> – fair
        <br>\t<b>Samus</b> – nair
        <br>\t<b>Yoshi</b> – uair
        <br>\t<b>Sheik</b> – nair
        <br>\t<b>Falco</b> – bair
        <br>\t<b>Young Link</b> – nair
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Application</b></big>
        <br>When used with aerial attacks that have little lag, a platform-canceled aerial attack can lead
        into lethal combos due to the incredibly small amount of lag. In comparison to the SHFFL, the
        characters jump animation and falling animation are both eliminated, removing somewhere from
        20-30 frames from an aerial attack. However, platform canceling could easily be considered the most
        difficult to use advanced technique in the game, requiring frame-perfect technical skill to be
        used consistently and effectively.
        <br>It is also possible to do this in Smash 64, as demonstrated through TAS style combos by Jpheal,
        and it is similarly incredibly difficult. However, it is only possible on rising platforms/diagonal platforms.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Advantages</b></big>
        <br>Erases the jumping and falling animations, replacing them with a one-frame crouching animation.
        Slow-starting aerial attack are auto-canceled, creating a mindgame option.
        <br>The speed of the technique allows for extremely fast combos, especially shield break combos.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Disadvantages</b></big>
        <br>Requires a platform which can be passed through.
        <br>Extremely strict timing

    <string name="pshield_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Powershield</b></big>
        <br>This is a technique where one activates a full shield such that it connects with an incoming attack on the first few frames. In
        order for the technique to be executed, one must rely on timing and skill. When the opponent is ready to strike, the player
        must quickly use the shield. If done correctly, the character takes no shield damage (or shield stun if a projectile was
        powershielded) and may immediately perform any action
        <br>Powershielding is done by quickly and fully depressing a shield button four frames before an attack connects. If done correctly,
        there will be a significant flash on the shield and a distinctive \"chlink\" sound. Because it is technically a shield, it is
        ineffective against grabs.
        <br>CPU players, especially level 9s, use this technique a lot. Human players don\'t use it as much simply because of the reaction
        times and precision usually required. As such, it often comes as a surprise and can momentarily disrupt a match. At high level
        play, powershielding can be used to reflect a wave of incoming projectiles such as Falco\'s laser, to punish camping.
        Powershielding can reflect projectiles during the first two frames.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Explanation</b></big>
        <br>Power shielding is accomplished by fully pressing L or R such that the shield appears
        just before the incoming attack would hit you. More specifically, the full shield bubble\'s inner reflection hitbox
        must connect with the hitbox of the incoming attack within 4 frames of activating the shield. Should a projectile
        hit on frames 1 or 2 of the powershield,
        the technique will reflect projectiles at half the original damage. Though the technique is difficult to perform
        consistently, powershielding is extremely valuable in competitive play, as it allows players to punish moves with
        low ending lag such as Fox\'s neutral aerial. Its ability to reflect projectiles is even more valuable as it allows
        players to punish otherwise safe, predictable projectile spam, particularly in the Falco matchup, whose lasers can
        shut off many options and leave a player completely helpless if not dealt with properly.
        <br>Though difficult, powershielding projectiles is still humanly possible to perform consistently. Players
        who use characters with projectiles often have an easily trackable firing pattern, such as firing projectiles only
        when there is a certain distance between the players. It is also important to note that players (again, Falco mains
        in particular) will short hop to move while firing. As such, a projectile user running or jumping away from pressure
        is often a surefire sign he or she intends to fire.
        <br>Powershield follow-up is also distance dependent. A laser is considered safe if fired when Falco and his opponent
        are standing a distance X between each other, where X is the max horizontal distance Falco can jump in 1 short hop.
        At this distance, powershielding the lasers yield no follow ups and attempting to move around them by jumping,
        rolling, or going under them with attacks that lower hurtboxes (like Marth\'s dash attack) put the opponent in
        positions Falco has an easier time winning neutral in. However, if the laser is fired too far away, for example at
        distance 1.5X, the laser is not safe, as powershielding does yield follow-ups such as a grab.
        <br>Yoshi\'s shield sometimes powershields attacks even when the shield is already up.

    <string name="platformwarp_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Platform warp</b></big>
        <br>Abbreviated as PW, Platform warping is taking advantage of ECB (Environmental Collision Box, the \"bones\"
        of the player model) changes after a double jump to quickly land onto platforms. The main difference
        between a platform warp and an AI (Aerial Interrupt) is that a platform warp takes place only on platforms and requires the
        character to perform a double jump, due to the changes in the ECB explained below.
        <br>Most characters can perform a no-impact landing on platforms using this technique, by dropping through the platform and
        then double jumping on the right frame.
        <br>
        <br><b>Other moves that can be used with platform warping include:</b>
        <br>\tFox - nair, fair, dair
        <br>\tSheik - all aerials except dair
        <br>\tSamus - fair, uair (fullhop)

        <br>\tDr. Mario & Mario - nair, uair

        <br>\tLuigi - nair
        <br>
        <br><b>Walljump platform warp</b>
        <br>It is also possible to perform a platform warp from a walljump, with the only discovered set ups (in legal stages)
        found in Pokemon Stadium. http://gfycat.com/AmusedSneakyGelding
        <br>You have only 1 frame of landing, since you are technically doing a NIL. Walljump gives you 14 frames of intangibility,
        and the amount of grounded actionable intangible frames you get is dependent on the frame of the walljump you cancel.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</b></big>
        <br>Every character has a ECB, which are essentially the bones of your character, it is a diamond shape,
        with the bottom point triggering landing when colliding with a surface. When on
        the ground, the bottom point will always be at the very bottom of your character, but in the air has many different
        patterns from different actions.
        <br>When you transition from grounded to airborne, the bottom point becomes locked for 9 frames, and since it
        was at the bottom of the character before, that is where it will be locked. On the 10th frame, the bottom point
        begins to follow the pattern of the action you are currently doing. The same thing happens when you double jump.
        <br>A platform warp abuses this by picking out a frame of an airborne action where the bottom point is high
        up, and double jumping. During the first 9 frames of the double jump, the bottom point will be locked at that
        high position. If on the 10th frame you are in an action where the bottom point is typically low, this will
        cause an instant downward extension. The platform warp uses this downward extension to touch a platform and trigger landing.

    <string name="reversewalljump_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Reverse wall jumping</b></big>
        <br>It is actually possible to perform a reverse wall jump with
        any character capable of wall jumping on tournament legal stages. This glitch is similar to the ledge wall jump
        which stores the wall jump from riding up Final Destination\'s ledge when you grab the ledge and when
        you press away it instantly activates the wall jump.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</big></b>
        <br>By manipulating the way the game detects wall jumps, the player can \"trick\" the game into thinking
        the player is wall jumping from an opposite facing wall. This is done by storing wall jumps through methods
        stated below. By performing a wall jump stored from the opposite wall you are currently on the game still gives
        you the same wall jump which would normally send you away from the stage but will now send you towards the stage.
        <br>Details on this here: http://pastebin.com/wHhscGty
        <br>This is why Fox is capable of doing a reverse wallump on his target test stage as seen in this
        video (https://youtu.be/rAN3SejRi3w) from 2009. Fox jumps and hugs the
        left wall until he touches the ground. Once on the ground the game stops updating if he is touching a wall.
        Since he walks up to the right wall before jumping when he goes airborne he is still hugging a wall and can
        activate the wall jump intended to be done off the left wall letting him perform a reverse wall jump.
        <br>
        <br><b>Ways of storing wall jumps</b>
        <br>
        <br>1. Use a grounded special including an Up-B\ (with the exception of Mario)against a wall. Even
        though Up-B\'s put you airborne and then into freefall this is considered a separate state called
        SpecialFall and the game does not update if you are hugging a wall in this state.
        <br>
        <br>2. Start a jump and on the frame before you go airborne enter an aerial or special
        move. With a frame perfect input your character will go from jumpsquat directly into an attack avoiding
        the freefall state. You can perform a 2nd aerial or special on the exact frame it ends to continue
        avoiding freefall, or use one of your characters aerials that can be interrupted during certain ending
        frames to make the timing much easier (You can only jump, attack, or grapple during IASA frames).
        <br>
        <br>3. Walk or wavedash off a ledge or platform. If you enter freefall in this way you
        can be airborne for exactly one frame before the game will update if you should still be capable of
        wall jumping. This allows Mario to wavedash backwards off a stage and input a frame perfect airdodge
        up so that he will drop and grab the ledge since he cannot use his Up-B to grab the ledge from on stage.
        <br>These new tricks to go airborne and keep a stored wall jump allow any character to jump into one
        side of the stages wall and use an Up-B or airdodge to return to the stage and navigate to
        the opposite wall or ledge. If you enter freefall while hugging a wall with a wall jump stored
        from the opposite wall you can reverse wall jump by letting the analog stick rest in neutral
        for one frame and pressing it into the wall on the next frame.
        <br>
        <br>It is also possible for Fox, Falco, Young Link, and Mario to perform a reverse wall jump
        from Final Destination\'s ledge by dropping from the ledge by inputting down or away
        on the control and the next frame pressing analog into the wall. Mario is also
        capable of performing this on FoD and Pokemon Stadium.

        <br>Shai dropping (also called running shield drop) is a technique for consistently doing frame perfect shield drops from a dash.
        <br>Shai drops allow the player to quickly shield drop from a dash and lets the player keep their momentum
        from the dash. They are also usually the fastest way to drop through a platform.
		<br>
		<br><big><b>Uses</b></big>
		<br>Shai drops can be useful in a situation where you\'d usually drop through the platform and NAir or FAir,

		<br><b>Method 1:</b> Dash, hold diagonal down in the direction of your dash/run
		(45°), and shield. not simultaneously, but one after another with just a small

		<br>This method is more lenient and
		potentially faster than the aforementioned stick down method since
		you don\'t need to worry spot dodging if you press the shield too soon after the stick is positioned.
		<br>The downside of this method is that you must have a decently precise joystick in
		order for it to be at all possible.
		<br>
		<br><b>Method 2:</b> Dash, hold straight down instead, and shield. Not simultaneously,
		but one after another with just a small moment apart (2-frame window) from positioning the stick down and shielding.
		<br>Shielding to early will result in a spot dodge and shielding too late will result in a normal shield.

    <string name="shieldpress_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Shield pressure</b></big>
        <br>Shield pressure is a combination of attacks that enables a
        character to break an opponent\'s shield without the opponent having to hold down shield for the
        duration of the combo.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</b></big>
        <br>Normally, when one is shielding and then lets go of the shield button, the shield disappears.
        This does not happen when the shield is under attack. If one lets go of shield while the opponent\'s
        attacks are making contact with the shield, the shield will stay until the attacks stop for a
        certain amount of time (this is called shield stun). As the attacks make contact, the shield
        gradually shrinks. If the shield size decreases too much, the shield will break, causing the
        shielder to become stunned in place for a few seconds, depending on the damage. Normally, there
        is enough delay after an attack to allow the shielder to remove the shield if he/she chooses to
        do so, but there exist certain combos in which attacks are executed quickly enough so that the
        shield stays up for the duration of the combo, at the end of which the shield breaks.
        <br>
        <br><b>A shield pressure combo must have these properties:</b>
        <br>The attack(s) have very little start up or cooldown delay. In other words, there exists very little time in between hitboxes
        The hitboxes of the attacks are rather large. The hitbox must make contact with the shield each time or
        else the shielder will be shield jabbed. Therefore, a large hitbox is required to hit the increasingly diminutive shield.
        <br>
        <br><b>Examples</b>
        <br>\tFox\'s Shine cancel chain
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Variants, special situations</b></big>
        <br>There exist combos that are not always called \"true shield break combos,\" but nevertheless can be
        utilized to break shields. These combos work only under certain situations. The two most common ones
        are the shield not being at full strength at the start of the combo and the shielder somehow being
        locked in a fixed position during the combo due to a feature of the stage.
        <br>
        <br><b>Examples</b>

        <br>
        <br>The last one can be skipped for certain aerials if the aerial is performed very early and has reached
        its auto-cancel frames or ended completely upon landing. For example, Marth\'s neutral aerial and
        forward aerial do not have a very long duration, so Marth will hit the ground after his aerial is over.
        This can be tested by using a short hop fast fall (without the L-cancel) with the aforementioned moves.
        The player should land without the usual special effects and minor lag. This phenomenon is known as an
        \"Autocanceled aerial\" or an \"Early SHFFL\", and in Marth\'s case, an \"AC Nair.\"

    <string name="shop_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Short hop</b></big>
        <br>Performed by pressing the jump button or pushing the control stick
        upward (easier if control stick isn\'t pushed all the way) and letting go before the character leaves the ground,
        this will results in a jump that is lower than a normal jump.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Usage in play</b></big>
        <br>The short hop technique is an essential move in competitive play, allowing the user to perform aerial attacks
        closer to the ground. This is useful for spamming aerials, especially with the SHFFL technique in Melee,
        as the aerials can be done closer to the ground and possibly hit targets who are still on the ground,
        with other techniques such as double jump canceling allowing even lower aerials. Hitting grounded
        targets is great for characters whose aerials play a significant part of their metagame, such as Ness.
        Characters who have strong aerial attacks, such as Captain Falcon, benefit from this greatly.
        Short hopped aerials are also very useful for aerial approaches and spacing, especially for characters
        such as Marth.
        <br>Jumping speed can affect the timing of the short hop. In Melee, for instance, a Fox player must release the jump
        button within 2 frames to short hop. Bowser, by contrast, requires 7 frames and so his short hops are
        much easier. The height of a short hop varies from character to character as well. Short hopping is also
        used during wavedashing, to an extreme degree. For frame data, refer to Jumping.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Smash DI</b></big>
        <br>Often shortened to SDI is a mechanic that allows players to slightly alter their position during
        the freeze frames of being hit by an attack. Tapping the control stick or C-Stick in any direction (rapidly, like
        how you rapidly tap the C-Stick when performing an aerial or smash attack), during freeze frames will slightly
        move their character in that direction, allowing them to potentially escape multi-hit moves or certain combos.
        <br>SDI can also be used to move into a wall or ceiling in order to tech near-instantly (and is also possible with
        floors if the character starts in the air) or to (very minimally) increase the distance from the blast line
        that the attack is about to send them towards.
        <br>Despite its near-identical name, SDI is not the same thing as directional influence.
        The major difference is that, while DI changes
        the trajectory a character is launched in while SDI changes a character\'s position before launch.
        <br>The mechanics of SDI operate by shifting the character in the given direction.
        As a result, repeatedly tapping in one direction will move the character
        much farther than simply holding the stick in that direction. This results in a technique
        called quarter-circle DI, which involves quickly rotating the stick between two \"notches\" for
        increased distance. Quarter-circle DI was introduced to the United States by smasher Captain Jack and was once
        known as Japanese DI.
        <br>As the C-Stick can also be used for SDI, even \stronger\" forms of SDI exist. So-called double-stick DI
        utilizes the C-Stick\'s ability to override the control stick by holding one of the sticks in one direction
        and utilizing quarter-stick DI with the other. This is often used when a player wants to SDI one way, and DI the other.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to properly perform</b></big>
        <br>What you do to SDI is simply jam the control stick the exact instant you are hit. This isn\'t done on reaction,
        you must be expecting the hit. This is mostly done to survive combos where you know a certain move must be
        used at a certain time. Because it is anticipated, you can actually throw people off by hitting them with a
        different move than they expect or changing the timing. For example, as Fox if they are SDIing your uair
        you can bair and they will have bad DI.
        <br>
        <br><b>Automatic smash directional influence</b>
        <br>ASDI is a weaker variant of SDI which uses the C-Stick. Once a character\'s freeze frames are
        over, they shift slightly in whatever direction the C-Stick is currently held, slightly less than
        one SDI input. If the C-Stick is also being held in a direction, it will override the control stick\'s input,
        allowing the player to DI in another direction simultaneously. To perform simply hold the C-Stick the direcion you want
        to SDI, this method is efficient for multi-hit attacks.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Shield DI</b></big>
        <br>If you are in a shield and someone attacks it, rapidly tapping the control stick or C-Stick similar to SDI
        will cause you to move your character in the direction where you are SDI\ing.
        <br>
        <br><b>This works extremely well with:</b>
        <br>\tMultiple hitting d-smashes (e.g. Peach, Sheik, Pikachu)
        <br>\tRapid jabs
        <br>\tShield pressure from Fox and Falco
        <br>\tThe lightshield edgehog vs Marth
        <br>\tOther multihit moves on shield
        <br>\tFalcon\'s raptor boost on shield
        <br>\tStrong attacks on shield that may seem unpunishable (like certain spacings of Falco\'s f-smash or d-tilt)

    <string name="twobble_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Team Wobble</b></big>
        <br>This is a group technique, performed by two players on a team continuously grabbing a single opponent
        just as they escape from the other\'s grab (or throw). Two players stand on each side of their target,
        with one grabbing and pummelling, the other waiting to catch the opponent when they manage to escape;
        they then trade duties and repeat.
        <br>The team wobble can also be performed with throws delivering low
        knockback; performing it with throws makes it impossible to escape out of using an air release and does
        not require prediction of the opponent\'s escape like the grab release version does. As long as both players
        grab correctly, this is a team infinite. Although all characters can perform this, those with fast and long
        grabs (such as Marth) are better at team wobbles than those with slow or short grabs (such as Bowser
        <br>It is possible to escape or at least disrupt a team wobble by forcing an air release via timely
        jump inputs.
        <br>This technique can be performed with two players on a team, or two opposing players working
        together (although they must be sure not to get hit by each others\' pummels).
        <bt>Because of stale-move negation,
        this strategy takes a large amount of time to build up notable damage, so is mostly use for stalling the game,

    <string name="tech_info_text"><![CDATA[How to tech: https://youtu.be/1R0yC4ztGPI
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Tech</b></big>
        <br>A tech is an action that can be performed when the player\'s character hits the
        ground, a wall, or a ceiling while tumbling or in hitstun. To tech, the user must press the shield button
        20 frames or fewer before hitting the surface; after that, a player won\'t be able to tech for 40 frames.
        Additional button or control stick input can cause different types of techs.
        <br>The word \"tech\" is borrowed from the competitive communities of other fighting games and traces its origin
        back to technical bonuses awarded in Capcom games for performing special maneuvers to escape grab attacks
        and get much less damage and more recovery time.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Types of techs</b></big>
        <br>
        <br><b>Standard tech</b>
        <br>A standing tech, standard tech, or neutral tech is a neutral, ground-based tech performed by pressing
        a shield button when a tumbling character comes in contact with the floor. The character will experience
        a brief period of invincibility, and will quickly bounce from the ground into a standing animation. The
        player will grab any items that he or she comes in contact with. This is the easiest tech to do, and is
        commonly done, even by casual players.
        <br>
        <br><b>Rolling tech</b>
        <br>A rolling tech (or PassiveStandF and PassiveStandB, depending on the direction chosen), also called a
        techroll, is a ground-based tech performed by tilting the control stick left or right when teching. The
        character will bounce from the ground into a roll-like animation during which the character moves left or
        right while invincible. This can allow characters to roll away from their impact point to complicate tech
        chasing, but rolling against an edge will halt the roll\'s sideways movement.
        <br>
        <br><b>Wall tech</b>
        <br>A wall tech (or PassiveWall) is a tech against a wall. To wall tech, the player must press a shield button
        20 frames or fewer before hitting the wall while tumbling, reeling, or in hitstun. 20 frames after each press
        is a 40 frame downtime window where a wall tech cannot be done, so button mashing reduces the player\'s likelihood
        of teching. As with normal techs, the wall teching character experiences a few invincibility frames, and the
        tech absorbs the player\'s momentum.
        <br>
        <br><b>Ledge tech</b>
        <br>A recovering character can use a form of wall tech to survive an edge-guarder. If the recovering character is
        hit with an attack very near to the ledge, he or she can smash DI towards the ledge and wall tech to absorb all
        the knockback of the enemy\'s attack. This is usually performed by pressing the shield button to wall tech before
        pressing the control stick to DI, because of the 20 frame window in which the player can input the tech before
        hitting the wall.
        <br>
        <br><b>Wall tech jump/Wall jump tech</b>
        <br>If a jump input is active when a wall tech is performed (such as holding Up or pressing a jump button), then
        the teching character will wall jump. This is known as a wall tech jump. Every character can wall tech jump,
        even those who cannot wall jump normally. A skilled player can survive a meteor smash (such as the Ice Climbers\'
        forward aerial that often ends their chaingrabs) by wall tech jumping.
        <br>
        <br><b>Ceiling tech</b>
        <br>A ceiling tech (or PassiveCeil) is a tech against a ceiling. To ceiling tech, the player must press the shield
        button 20 frames or fewer before hitting the ceiling, while in hitstun. 20 frames after each press is a 40 frame
        downtime window where a ceiling tech cannot be done, so mashing buttons reduces the player\'s likelihood of teching.
        As with normal techs, the ceiling teching character experiences a few invincibility frames, and the tech absorbs
        most of the momentum. There are few situations where there is a ceiling for a player to tech off of, but
        it can happen quite frequently in the caves of life in some stages.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Usefulness and application</b></big>
        <br>Teching can be a lifesaver in many situations and is a good technique for beginners to learn and practice.
        Teching can also help the user escape from combos.
        <br>Occasionally after accumulating sufficient damage, one will experience a wall or ceiling rebound that will send the
        player plummeting off-stage. This can be prevented by applying a wall or ceiling tech, saving the player from a
        deadly ricochet. This is especially useful in caves of life, e.g. Temple: a character in the large lower section
        of the stage can survive to very high damage and can immediately retaliate from otherwise-deadly blows. This unusual
        longevity is one reason Temple and similar stages are banned from tournaments.
        <br>The standing and rolling techs can be performed in more situations, such as allowing a character to avoid continued
        assault after being knocked back. However, an opponent can frequently predict a player\'s tech patterns and strike him
        or her again after knocking him or her down; deliberately setting up such situations is known as \"tech-chasing\".
        <br>Edge-teching helps keep the character on the stage, or at least making it possible to recover to the stage.
    ]]></string>
    <string name="techchase_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Tech-chasing</b></big>
        <br>Tech-chasing is the act of following or predicting an opponent\'s tech or
        floor recovery in order to attack them before they can respond. Because a character\'s tech animations have
        small windows of vulnerability before ending and allowing action, it is possible to read the direction of a
        player\'s tech and punish them. Characters with fast movement speeds like Captain Falcon are very good at
        tech-chasing as they can reach the opponent\'s destination faster, though those with long-reaching attacks
        like Marth can do similarly well. With characters like Sheik placing extremely well at tourneys due to
        their ability to tech chase Fox.
        <br>Projectiles can also do a good job of tech-chasing when timed correctly.
        Tech-chasing is much easier to do on characters with short tech rolls than those with long
        tech rolls (such as Zelda).
        <br>It is possible to tech-chase with a powerful slow-to-start move in certain situations, such as when the
        roll direction is predicted, or the defender is against an edge or a wall and ends up rolling towards it,
        therefore not moving. Teching in place (without rolling) can also allow this.
        <br>Some characters are able to incorporate tech-chasing into a chain grab sequence. A classic example is
        Captain Falcon\'s up throw against fast-fallers in Melee. After he throws, Captain Falcon can gain another
        grab by successfully tech-chasing his enemy.

    <string name="walljump_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Wall Jump</b></big>
        <br>This is a technique some characters may use in which one momentarily
        clings to the wall, turns away, and then jumps back. It is performed by touching a wall and then pressing
        the control stick or d-pad in the direction opposite the wall.
        <br>A wall jumping character experiences a short period of
        invincibility at the moment he or she kicks off the wall. One cannot wall jump forever, as the height one
        gains from each successive wall jump decreases until they actually lose height.
        <br>Additionally, all characters can perform a wall jump directly after wall teching. This technique is
        often used by players recovering against an edge-guarder.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Characters who can wall jump</b></big>
        <br>\tCaptain Falcon
        <br>\tFalco

        <br><big><b>Wall jump stalling</b></big>
        <br>A few characters can still stall for quite some time if they continue to wall jump
        off the same wall over and over again.
        <br>
        <br>Young Link (and Captain Falcon) can perform this technique like so: as soon as you leave the wall,
        input Back-Air and hold back towards the wall. As soon as you touch the wall, tap away again and
        repeat the process. This technique works because performing an aerial will interrupt the preset
        arc that your character would normally jump in. Once the Aerial begins, you have control over your
        character, and can pull them back towards the stage. Because you can\'t wall jump during an attack,
        you want to use your shortest Aerial. Both Back-Air and Neutral-Air last 40 frames for YL, but
        Back-Air is significantly easier to execute, since you can just smash both sticks towards the stage.

    <string name="wavedash_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Wavedash</b></big>
        <br>A wavedash is a technique
        that is performed by air dodging diagonally into the ground, causing the character to slide a short distance.
        High-level play of Melee effectively requires proper use of the technique;
        the Melee community sees wavedashing as an advanced technique superior to dashing because it allows players to
        perform any ground action while moving horizontally on the ground. Use of the technique is especially important
        for the metagame of characters with poor traction, such as Luigi, Mewtwo, and the Ice Climbers, and almost every
        other character requires some use of wavedashing for positioning and maneuvering, particularly in combos and mindgames.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Technical details</b></big>
        <br>Wavedashing describes a sliding motion that occurs by jumping and then immediately air dodging at a
        sharp angle into the ground. The length a character slides in their wavedash is determined by a number
        of factors: by the angle at which they air dodged (low angles yield long wavedashes), how close to
        ground they were before air dodging (the closer the character, the longer the wavedash), and the
        character\'s traction. Low traction yields long wavedashes, while high traction yields short
        wavedashes. Thus characters like Luigi, Ice Climbers, and Marth have long wavedashes, while Peach
        and Zelda have short wavedashes. Both long and short wavedashes have their own advantages and
        disadvantages; while long wavedashes are generally better for approaching and wavesmashing, shorter
        wavedashes are better for comboing and positioning.
        <br>As the length of a wavedash is dependent on the character\'s traction, surfaces which reduce
        traction can significantly increase the lengths of wavedashes for all characters, such as the UFO
        on Fourside and the oil slick on Flat Zone. However, none of the tournament legal stages for
        Melee feature such surfaces.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Performing the technique</b></big>
        <br>Traditionally, wavedashing is the technique-to-know for newer players, for
        a mastery of wavedashing reflects both a nimbleness of fingers and a knowledge of
        high-level play. It is performed by pressing X or Y (or up on the control stick) to
        jump, followed immediately by L or R, and diagonally down on the control stick, to
        perform the air dodge. Ideally, the wavedashing character should slide without ever
        appearing to leave the ground.
        <br>Because wavedashing can be difficult to master, some players train themselves
        by wavedashing directly from a crouching position, which provides them the opportunity
        to wavedash only by pressing the two buttons (jump and air dodge) instead of timing a
        control stick movement as well. This method of wavedashing, however, is slow and not
        optimal for battle.
        <br>The speed of a character\'s jump also impacts the timing of their wavedash - the
        time interval between the jump and the air dodge is greater for characters with slow
        jumps (like Bowser and Link) and smaller for characters with fast jumps (like Fox and
        Pikachu). That said, during a match, one must compensate for startup lag in a wavedash,
        depending on the character being used.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Advantages of wavedashing</b></big>
        <br>While in a wavedash, the character is considered by the game to be standing - thus,
        they can perform any ground attacks that could normally be performed from a standing
        position, such as smashes, standing grabs and jabs. The character also retains all of
        their standing defensive maneuvers such as sidestepping and shielding. With this extra
        utility, wavedashing enables a moving versatility dashing can\'t match.
        <br>Another advantage lies in the ability to wavedash backwards while facing forwards,
        which allows characters to perform standing attacks while moving both backwards and
        forwards. This is helpful for mindgames, especially with characters with longer
        wavedashes. This technique also allows relatively safer retreats from opponents, and
        should the player fall off the stage with the wavedash, they will immediately grab
        onto the ledge, giving rise to a powerful and fast edgeguard option.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Wonky sides</b></big>
        <br>Recovery on this stage is considered difficult for many characters due to the very thin edges on either end. If a player
        misses the edge with an aimed up special move, they will end up underneath or away the stage, and suffer a possible
        KO or SD. It is more difficult to sweet spot the edge using characters such as Marth and Fox on this stage compared to other
        similar stages.
        <br>Although Fox and Falco can survive if they end up under Battlefield with proper spacing, as seen here:
        https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/3sy8b6/fox_can_grab_battlefield_ledge_from_under_the/
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Advantages and Disadvantages</b></big>
        <br>This stage gives advantages to characters who move horizontally during their recoveries, such as Falcon or
        Peach. The wonky ledges cause recoveries to not properly sweetspot or grab the ledge when they complete,
        characters like Falco and Fox usually take the biggest hit from this.
        <br>The stage offers wide horizontal blastzones, and smaller vertical blastzones. While vertical knockback
        still matters here, it doesn\'t matter as much when compared to FoD or Yoshi\'s Story.

        <br><big><b>Dream Land</b></big>
        <br>This is a simple stage, similar to other stages like Super Smash Bros. Melee\'s Battlefield and Fountain of Dreams where
        it has 3 platforms floating over a main one. Whispy Woods, a recurring boss in the Kirby series, is also in the middle of the
        stage, facing left. He will blow toward one side of the stage every so often to mess up the battle. His wind seems a little
        more powerful here than it is on Melees similar stage, Green Greens, likely because that he blows more often there. This
        stage is legal in SSB competitive play. Bronto Burts and King Dedede can also be seen flying in the far background.
        <br>
        <br>Dream Land is Kirbys home stage, and it is also the stage where Ness is fought while being unlocked (this could be
        because both characters come from games developed by SSB developer HAL Laboratory).
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Advantages and Disadvantages</b></big>
        <br>This stage has very large blastzones, with mainly the vertical ones being noticeable, this stage gives an advantage
        to characters that have to \"go in for the kill\", like Fox and Peach to take their opponent out with a Down-B or aerial.
        <br>The stage has platforms, giving more options to characters who\'s recoveries are usually predictable.

        <br>Sometimes abbreviated as FD or Final D, Final Destination is a neutral stage in Super Smash
        Bros. Melee that players often use in tournament battles. It is unlocked by clearing every event match.
        <br>
        <br>In Classic Mode, the player fights Master Hand and Crazy Hand on this stage; in Adventure Mode, Bowser and Giga Bowser;
        in All-Star Mode, Roy and any of his teammates, and two All-Star Matches, Mewtwo and Ganondorf. Some event matches are also
        played here. In Classic Mode, every time the player lowers Master and Crazy Hands stamina, the background changes.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Appearance</b></big>
        <br>Final Destination is a flat, medium sized stage. It is octagonal in shape, with a purple outline. There is a floating
        orb under the platform. While having no effect on gameplay, the background of the stage changes as the platform \"flies\"
        through space. The stage starts out in space, but as match progresses, it reaches other areas that have different styles
        of background. The entire cycle lasts about 216 seconds.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Advantages</b></big>
        <br>The stage\'s platformless style gives benefits to chain grabbers and tech-chasers.
        Falco also benefits from the flat form of the stage, as it let\'s Falco successfully SHL and stop
        his opponents in their actions.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Disadvantages</b></big>
        <br>Characters who usually have several options to recover are held back in this stage, as there are no other platforms
        to recover onto and the opponent can easily cover most of their options.

        <br>Announced at E3 2001, FoD is a starter stage in Melee.
        It is a very popular stage for quite a few reasons. One of them is because its a very basic stage. It resembles
        the Battlefield stage in the fact that it has a large lower platform and three elevated ones. The bottom main platform
        is flat the whole way through without any obstacles in the way. The left lower platform and the right lower platform are
        the same length. They both, over time, move up and down in no particular correspondence. They can rise to be as high as
        just under the highest platform, or drop to the point where they sink through the level, thereby making them impossible
        to stand on. The fourth platform is at the very top and is the same length as the other aforementioned elevated platforms.
        The top platform does not move in any direction. Interestingly, this stage is a tournament neutral stage for one-on-one
        tournaments, but is often banned in team tournaments, due to its small size and lagging.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Advantages and disadvantages</b></big>
        <br>The stage\'s most standing out features are its small blastzones over the top, left and right, and its long, spacious
        bottom blastzone which gives characters who can wall jump and tether grab an advantage.
        <br>The stage\'s style also gives characters with strong horizontal knockback moves (peach and sheik) an advantage, while
        giving light characters a disadvantage.
        <br>
        <br>The music for this stage is an orchestral arrangement of the main Gourmet Race music from Kirby Super Star.

        <br>Kongo Jungle is a stage in Melee, and is one of Donkey Kong\'s home stages. The stage is based on various
        levels from Donkey Kong Country, with pre-rendered backgrounds, environmental themes and tracks, and,
        most notable in a battle, use of a Barrel Cannon for transportation (usually for a vertical recovery).
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Description</b></big>
        <br>This stage appears as a starter stage in Super Smash Bros. This stage is made up of a big
        platform with four small platforms above it. Two small stationary platforms are above the left
        and right sections of the stage, and between them are two smaller platforms that circulate clockwise.
        The main platform can be passed through from below, but not from above. Under the stage there is a
        Barrel Cannon that can greatly aid many characters\' recovery.
        <br>A player that gets into the barrel can
        exit either by pressing a button or waiting for a certain period of time. In either case, they will
        be shot in the direction that the arrow on the barrel is currently pointing. There can only be one
        character at the time in the barrel.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Competitive play</b></big>
        <Br>the stage was usually regarded at first to be a counterpick. Although it had a relatively
        non-obtrusive stage design, it had a large size, which gave an advantage to faster characters and
        characters with projectiles, as well as a high ceiling, giving a slightly larger reliance on horizontal
        finishers.
        <br>However, the stage is currently banned in singles, since characters such as Peach and Jigglypuff
        were found to be very powerful on the stage due to the layout allowing easy circle camping. A match between
        Pink Shinobi and RockCrock at GENESIS is particularly infamous, and commonly regarded as one of the primary
        reasons why the stage was banned. However, the stage remains a counterpick in doubles due to the 4-character
        gameplay removing the camping disadvantages, but the stage is seldom picked in tournaments, so much so that
        it is being fazed out of stage selection for doubles tournaments altogether.

        <br><big><b>Pokémon Stadium</b></big>
        <br>Announced at E3 2001, this stage debuted in Super Smash Bros. Melee.
        <br>The basic stage is symmetrical and consists of one large main platform at the bottom and two smaller overhanging soft ones.
        However, after a varying period of time the basic stage transforms into one of four random variations, turning back to the basic
        version after a while. The same variation can appear twice in a row, with the basic version always in between. In all variation,
        under the main platform there is an impassable pillar.
        <br>
        <br>On the background there is a large screen which can display the battle itself, a symbol representing the upcoming variation
        during a stage transition, or the current standing of players.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Grass Variation</b></big>
        <br>The Grass variation takes place in some kind of forest or park. The main platform has slightly elevated plateaus on both sides.
        A small stream separates the left plateau and the central area, causing a slight depression. A wooden structure with two platforms,
        one above the other, occupies the middle-left part of the stage, while in the right part there is a tree whose
        branches form a third platform.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Water Variation</b></big>
        <br>The Water variation takes place near a pond or lake. The whole right side is occupied by a flat pond, while on the left there is
        a small elevated pier which slopes down on both its sides. Over the pond, two soft platforms are suspended by water spouts, the right one higher than the left one.
        <br>On the left side there is a windmill: its arms spin slowly and can be stood upon, but players on the current lowest arm fall.
        <br>This windmill can provide safe options for characters like Fox or Falco on choosing how to recovery onto the stage.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Fire Variation</b></big>
        <br>The Fire variation takes place in a burning forest. The center of the main platform is occupied by a small depression. On the
        left side there is a ruined tree: players can stand on top of it, but, due to its height, often need double jumping to reach its
        top. From the left side of the tree stems a branch which supports a soft floating platform.
        <br>On the right side there is a burning shack, the roof of whose porch acts as another soft platform. Note that the fire in the
        background is purely aesthetical and has no gameplay effect.
        <br>This variant is known to give opportunities for infitites with shines and down tilts (Pichu or Pikachu), and allows for spacies
        to camp in the small part inside the tree.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Rock Variation</b></big>
        <br>The Rock variation takes place in a canyon near a mine. Its terrain is the most uneven of all versions. The right part is
        flat and empty, while in the middle there are three soft platforms one above the other, of which the bottom one touches
        the ground and can be walked up from it.
        <br>The left side is occupied by a large solid mountain, on whose right side stem two more soft platforms. The walls it
        creates can cause infinites and caves of life. The top of the mountain itself acts as a solid platform. The mountains
        left side is almost vertical and ends almost at the right edge of the stage, leaving however a small walkable space.

        <br><big><b>Yoshi\'s Story</b></big>
        <br>Announced at E3 2001, this is a stage in Super Smash Bros. Melee.
        <br>It is a very basic, neutral
        stage, similar in structure to Battlefield. The bottom part is primarily flat with the left and right side sloped down at a minor
        angle. There are three platforms that float above the bottom platform: A low left one, a high middle one, and a low right one.
        The main platform has walls which continue to the bottom of the stage, unlike Battlefield, so that characters cannot become stuck
        on the bottom trying to recover. The lack of intrusive stage elements aside from the moving cloud makes this a neutral stage for
        tournaments.
        <br>
        <br>The stage also features a small floating cloud, colloquially dubbed \"Randall\" (see below). Additionally, there are Shy Guys
        which fly around in groups of 1-6 in a line. If items are enabled, specifically food, the Shy Guys will be holding food
        which they release onto the stage when hit. Even when food is not present, Shy Guys can affect gameplay: they will interfere
        with projectiles, and moves such as Green Missile and Raptor Boost, and they are useful for countering stale-move negation,
        through hitting them with attacks not commonly used.
        <br>Pak E. Derm can be seen pacing back and forth in the background.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Advantages and Disadvantages</b></big>
        <br>This stage has small blastzones all over along with high platforms, giving characters that have moves with high vertical
        knockback (Fox) an advantage, and characters with a spike that has plenty of hitstun (Falcon, Falco) an advantage.
        <br>Peach gets a slight advantage on this stage due to her ability to wallbomb in order to recover. Although her lighter weight
        does not fair her well on this stage, as lighter characters are easier to knock out in stages with smaller blastzones.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Randall the Cloud</b></big>
        <br><b>Randall the Cloud</b> is a nickname for the Lakitus Cloud featured on this stage. It moves in a rectangle through the bottom
        of the stage. It is possible to hang/stand/edgeguard on the cloud until it goes back into the stage. It is often used to
        assist the recovery process. The term derived originally from Canadian smasher FastFox, and it has since taken off as a norm
        on SmashBoards.
        <br>It is also mentioned commonly in competitive Melee matches, usually when a player chooses to land on it instead
        of aiming for the edge while recovering, or when it comes out and saves a recovering player who otherwise wouldve been edgehogged.
        <br>Randall does not appear for the opening ten seconds of a given battle and emerges on the right-hand side of Yoshis Story immediately
        thereafter, completing a trip through the stage and out the other side in 20 seconds. This means that the position of the cloud
        is consistent and predictable, not random. Through paying particular attention to the countdown in a timed match, a prudent smasher
        can use this knowledge to effectively stall a recovery and land on Randall instead of falling.
        <br>Randall the Cloud can also be used for taunt canceling.

        <br>Falco is an unlockable character in Super Smash Bros. Melee
        who is currently 2nd in the tier list due to good ability to combo, and having arguably
        the best projectile in the game. Top Falco players are notorious for their high levels of
        technical ability.
        <br>
        <br>Due to Falco\'s fast falling, he has resistance to juggling, is hard to hit in
        the air, and can perform SHFFLs well. On the downside,
        his recovery is shortened, and he is vulnerable to combos and chaingrabs that work on Fast fallers. However,
        he can chaingrab floaties.
        <br>
        <br>Falco\'s excellent short hop makes him very good at combos and short hop lasers. His short hop lasers prevent
        most characters from approaching and can increase pressure on the opponent. His Reflector not only reflects
        projectiles, but can also be used for combo opportunities like pillaring. Falco also has the highest initial jump,
        the ability to wall jump, and a very effective Down Aerial spike.
        <br>
        <br>Like Fox, Falco is lightweight and has a very poor recovery. Not only
        does he have the aforementioned fast-falling problem, but also the slowest air speed, along with Fox. Falcos Up
        Special Move, Fire Bird is very easy to edgeguard, due to its large start-up lag and linear nature. Additionally,
        it also lacks the flinching effect during the charge-up time and recovery distance of Fox\'s. His Side Special Move,
        Falco Phantasm, is difficult to shorten consistently, but is faster at recovering than
        Fox\'s Fox Illusion.

        <br><b>Post for Falcon:</b> http://smashboards.com/threads/the-falcon-index-thread-new-post-of-the-week-by-magus.307911/
        <br>
        <br>Captain Falcon currently ranks 8th place on the Melee tier list (in the B tier). He ranks rather high
        because he of his incredible comboing abilities; he has a fast falling speed and air speed, and the
        fastest dash of all characters, giving him one of the best SHFFLs in the game. His above average weight and fast falling
        speed makes him the most resistant character to vertical KOs. His speed, fast rolls, and Raptor Boost enable an excellent
        dodging and tech-chasing game.
        <br>
        <br>Falcon also has multiple quick KO moves, most notably his Knee Smash, forward smash, and
        down aerial, all of which can be combo finishers. Against other high-tiered opponents, however, Falcon is susceptible
        to chaingrabs and combos due to his high falling speed. He is also prone to edgeguarding, since he has a predictable
        recovery that, like in Smash 64, cannot grab ledge-hanging enemies. Falcon lacks a projectile, impairing his approach
        in some matchups, while most of his attacks have long start-up and lack extended hitbox duration, making his approaches
        very committal in general. As such, Falcon is considered to have one of the most inconsistent neutral games among
        top-tiered characters. Regardless of his weaknesses, Captain Falcon still has an impressive number of winning matchups,
        including six that are near-unloseable.

        <br><b>Helpful guide on Fox:</b> http://smashboards.com/guides/guide-to-ace-arwing-pilot-fox-mccloud-updated-for-2015.100/
        <br>
        <br>Fox currently ranks 1st on the SS tier in the tier list, true to his position he is
        an extremely efficient fighter, with fast attacks, excellent comboing and damaging ability,
        long recovery options, and numerous options to approach the opponent, boasting some of the best neutral game options among
        the entire cast. He has KO options and setups at a wide variety of percentages, and his high falling speed makes him resilient
        to vertical KOs. His aerial game also includes several low-lag yet effective and powerful moves to complement his ground game,
        especially when SHFFLd, and is incredibly effective at approaching and edgeguarding. Fox\'s main tool in his success, however,
        is his Reflector (also known as the shine), which is one of the most versatile tools in the game. Aside from its intended purpose,
        it is the fastest move in the game, has set knockback, and can be jump canceled; this allows for shine spike gimps, neutral stance
        resets, getup option mixups, and even combos when wavedashing is incorporated. Despite being top tier, Fox is not flawless. He has
        an extremely high technical learning curve, as most of his techniques require extremely nimble fingers and fast reaction time.
        <br>
        <br>Additionally, he also has a very high cerebral learning curve as Fox players must be wary of making even a single mistake. Fox\'s
        high falling speed makes him very easy to combo and chaingrab off of a single conversion from the opponent, and his light weight
        can result in extremely early horizontal KOs if the players DI is poor. Although he boasts a very long recovery distance, he only
        has linear recovery options, which makes it easier for certain characters like Marth to predict his recovery path and edgeguard or gimp him.
        <br>
        <br>Regardless, his pros greatly outshine his cons, and Fox is notable for being one of two characters in Melee (the other
        and Falco) to have no disadvantageous matchups, with only three (Falco, Marth and Samus) being considered even.

        <br><b>What makes Ganon good:</b> https://youtu.be/kZNJhUld7Ek
        <br><b>Q & A thread:</b> http://smashboards.com/threads/how-to-wreck-es-with-ganon-linguini-q-a-thread.215432/
        <br>
        <br>Ganondorf currently ranks 14th in the E tier on the Melee tier list. Ganondorf boasts extreme power, good reach, decent chaingrabbing
        ability, and very useful aerials, including the strongest meteor smash in the game in his down aerial. He also has several effective
        edgeguarding options including the aforementioned down aerial, both the strong and weak hitboxes of his up aerial, and his back
        aerial. Nonetheless, Ganondorf has extreme flaws to counteract these great strengths as well. He has a bad neutral game due to his
        poor dash dance and lack of non-commital approaching moves, forcing Ganondorf players to rely more on reads and baits, and the
        punishes that come with them.
        <br>
        <br>However, Ganondorf is also very susceptible to punishes himself, as he is easily comboed and chaingrabbed
        due to his size and weight, and is very easily edgeguarded due to his very predictable (albeit long) recovery. He is also vulnerable
        to projectiles and has few ways to deal with characters that outrange him or have very fast attacks. Because of this, while Ganondorf
        has good matchups against other mid-tier and low-tier characters, including two nearly unloseable ones against Pichu and Kirby,
        he struggles against the top tier characters (especially Fox and Sheik).

        <br>Sheik used to be first on the Melee tier list until the eighth version of it, where Fox now currently takes the top spot. Sheik now ranks
        4th on the tier list, in the S tier primarily due to her chain throw, excellent combos, a great finisher in her f-air, a very
        good approach due to fast aerials and high jumps, and one of the best edgeguarding games in Melee. Sheik, however, suffers from a
        relatively short and predictable recovery, as well as a rather short but quick wavedash. Also, most of her moves are weak for
        an attack of their type.

        <br>Mario is ranked 15th on the current tier list in the E tier.
        Mario acts as a well-rounded character, with average weight, falling speed and other such attributes.
        He also has above-average comboing ability, and a very versatile grab game; his powerful back throw can gimp recoveries, and his down
        throw can chain-grab. Mario also has decent edge-guarding, with Fireball (a solid projectile), and his Cape which can easily and
        efficiently gimp almost every other characters recovery. Mario, however, lacks a reliable finisher, and his recovery is predictable
        and short, though he can extend it.]]></string>

        <br><b>Chaingrab info:</b> http://smashboards.com/threads/detailled-chaingrab-information.323364/
        <br>
        <br>Marth currently ranks 3rd place on the tier list, in the S tier. This is due to fast overall startup in his attacks, long and disjointed range,
        large amounts of extra power when attacks hit at the tip of his blade, very potent juggling and combo ability with one of the largest
        non-disjointed grab ranges, and a great edgeguarding ability. Marth is also blessed with a multitude of good movement options to
        approach and pressure with. He has a long dash dance and a long wavedash, both of which compliment his large reach. Marth also has
        many options to KO enemies and close combos, such as his down aerial (a very potent spike when sweetspotted, and the closer to the
        notorious Ken Combo) and forward smash. Compared to other top-tier characters, Marth\'s learning curve is not very high as he does
        not require an extensive amount of tech skill to be used effectively, making him easy to pick up and play. On the downside, his ability
        to punish approaches are somewhat limited in comparison to other top tier characters due to the lack of a projectile and the short
        duration of his moves.
        <br>
        <br>Marth also suffers from a general lack of options when put on the defensive. His weight makes him very easy to
        combo and does not provide sufficient knockback resistance to survive heavy hits at kill percent. Marth\'s out of shield game is also
        notoriously poor. His recovery is also problematic; while it is extendable with his side special and can end with a fast up special
        that covers decent distance, it is also rather predictable. Marth\'s main weakness though is that despite the fast startup of his moves,
        his moves have considerable endlag and are thus very whiff punishable. As such Marth is very susceptible to momentum shifts; a punished
        move puts Marth in a defensive position where he has little options. So overall, despite his low technical learning curve, many consider
        Marth to be one of the most difficult characters to play at high levels due to the intricate spacing ability required of top-level players
        to overcome his aforementioned flaws. Regardless of these flaws, Marth has excellent match-ups against many characters, including six that
        are nearly unloseable.

        <br>
        <br>Pichu is currently ranked 24th in the G tier, the lowest ranked clone character. This is due to its terrible range and that most characters can
        easily chain throw it, despite its small size and its status as the lightest character in the game, which are also its flaws. It takes
        damage from its own electric attacks, hindering its KOing ability, as most of its finishing attacks involve electricity. Pichu does
        have strengths, such as a surprisingly good grab game; Pichu is very quick and most of its attacks have little to no start-up lag. Pichu
        also has a decent air game and a slew of powerful attacks, some even more powerful than those of its counterpart. Regardless, Pichu
        suffers from abysmal matchups, and it has the highest amount of very unfavorable matchups of any character in any Smash game, having a
        total of twelve. By comparison, Kirby, the lowest on the tier list, has seven, and Bowser, the third lowest on the tier list, has six.
        Furthermore, Pichu has no advantageous matchups, with three being even (against Yoshi, Kirby and Bowser). It appears that Pichu is
        intended to be a sub-par character since its trophy descriptions mention that it is \"top of the class in weakness\" and it is
        \"best suited for handicapped matches.\"

        <br>Currently, Peach is 6th in the A tier, the highest ranked of any Mario character.
        Her float cancel gives her a fantastic aerial game, and she can play mindgames by using Toad. Peach also has good
        chaingrabbing abilities, which is particularly useful against higher tiered characters. She is also the owner of one of the best
        projectiles in the game. Additionally, Peachs recovery is among the best in the game, with many options available to her, allowing
        her to recover at almost any angle. However, Peachs primary flaw is her light weight and floatiness, which makes her more susceptible
        to KOs, especially on the upper blast lines. Additionally, her slow dash and weak ground attacks, save for her down smash, impair
        her approach while on the ground.

        <br>Ness is currently ranked 23rd in the F tier. While still having fantastic throws and a great aerial game due to his double jump cancel,
	    Ness has a poor approach on the ground and in the air due to significant range issues in most of his attacks; his recovery is also easy
	    to intercept and edgeguard against, and he also has significant trouble KOing opponents, again owing to his poor range. As a result of
	    these significant weaknesses, Ness has terrible matchups, with six unfavorable, one even (against Yoshi), and only three favorable
	    (against Bowser, Kirby, and Pichu).]]></string>

        <br>Mewtwo is ranked 21st on the current tier list, in the F tier. While initially deemed the worst character in the game, the changing metagame
        of Melee caused Mewtwo to experience a rise of five places. Mewtwos good attributes include a long, safe, and difficult-to-counter recovery,
        a rather good chaingrabbing ability, a large variance of mix-up options, a decent combo ability, and among the best throws in the game. However,
        Mewtwo suffers from an unusual combination of being a large target and a lightweight; this, combined with its floatiness, makes it easy to KO.
        Additionally, Mewtwo has limited KOing options, with most of them having little reach, and many weak attacks, giving it relatively fewer approach
        and offensive options as other characters.]]></string>

        <br>Link is ranked 18th in the tier list, in the E tier just two places
        below his clone, Young Link. Links placement is due to a very good approach due to some low lag aerials (with his neutral and forward air), a
        good variety of projectiles and a very high air speed. A disjointed hitbox also gives Link a slight advantage against others, as well as a fully
        functional shield that can block a wide variety of projectiles. Link is also a potent edgeguarder in the NTSC versions of the game; his Spin
        Attack is possibly the best semi-spike in the game, though he still has many other options. Link, however, suffers from a rather high falling
        speed and a high weight, making him an easy target for chain grabbing and combos. His recovery is also predictable, though he can extend it
        slightly.

        his ability to wall jump, bomb jump and use his hookshot give him some options. Young Links recovery, however, is particularly disappointing for

        attacks with transcendent priority. Zeldas primary weakness, however, is her poor movement, due to having the slowest dash speed in the game
        (along with Jigglypuff), slow falling, and air speed, which together with her very high traction results in the shortest wavedash in the game
        (along with Peach). Additionally, despite Zeldas somewhat long recovery, her recovery is very easily edgeguarded and/or edgehogged. This

        powerful KO move that can easily be comboed into, and an overall great aerial game and developed metagame.
        <br>Its floatiness also makes it the
        only character in the top tier who cannot be easily comboed or chaingrabbed, which is also aided by its small size, which allows Jigglypuff
        to avoid most KO setups that most other characters would fall vulnerable to. Regardless, Jigglypuff still has problems. It is light and floaty,
        making it easier to KO with stray moves or certain low percentage setups than other characters.
        <br>Jigglypuffs options on the ground are also
        limited, because of its poor range and a lack of a projectile. It also has a slow walking speed and dashing speed. Compounded with a poor dash
        dance, Jigglypuffs neutral game, which is largely committal, is not as good as that of other top-tiered characters; instead, it relies on its
        lethal punishes, edgeguards, and aerial mobility to succeed.
        <br>Recent developments in the Melee metagame have also worsened Jigglypuffs matchups
        against other top-tier characters, such as Fox, Marth, and Falco. Regardless, Jigglypuff still has an excellent amount of favorable matchups,
        with its only true disadvantageous matchup being Fox, and two of its matchups are
        nearly unloseable (against Ness and Pichu).

        <br>Mr. Game &amp; Watch is currently ranked 19th in Melees tier list. Mr. Game &amp; Watch\'s positive attributes include extremely powerful KO moves that have a
        long duration as well as a slew of moderately effective special moves, two of which (Judge and Oil Panic) can give a OHKO. However, Mr. Game &amp;
        Watch\'s flaws are due to how he was translated to Melee; he has a bad approach due to his slow overall speed, and outside of his throws, he is
        rather predictable. His high hitstun and light weight also make him an easy target for combos. Mr. Game &amp; Watch also has the dubious distinction
        of being the only character in the game who cannot L-cancel all of his aerial attacks, and is considered to have one of the worst shields in the
        game, as it fails to completely cover his entire body after even slight damage. All of this gives him very poor matchups against a majority of
        the cast, including three nearly unwinnable matchups, although there are five matchups in his favor.]]></string>

        <br>Donkey Kong is currently 17th on the tier list in the E tier. Donkey Kong, true to being a heavyweight, is difficult to KO, and this is aided by his fast falling
        speed. Donkey Kong also has powerful attacks, and he has excellent range to boot. Despite his weight and size, Donkey Kong is very agile; most
        of his attacks are executed swiftly, he has good air speed, and his jumping prowess is surprisingly good. His mobility facilitates combos, and
        this is further aided by his remarkable grab. However, Donkey Kong himself is easy to combo due to his large frame, and his recovery is among
        the worst in the game vertically (though it is rather good horizontally). Due to these traits, Donkey Kong is seen as a below-average character.]]></string>

        <br>Dr. Mario currently ranks 11th in Melee’s tier list at the top of the D tier, four places higher than Mario\'s rank. His relatively high tier placement is a
        consequence of his combo ability with overall uniqueness as a fighter, such as an unusual sex kick. His approach options are also very good, with a
        long wavedash and a good air game, as well as a very good SHFFL. Dr. Mario also has a good projectile, which itself can be used to aid his approach.
        However, Dr. Mario\'s primary weakness is his abysmal recovery, which is one of the worst in the game, due to its predictability and few methods of
        increasing its distance. Dr. Mario also suffers from lack of range in his attacks, leaving him vulnerable against characters with disjointed hitboxes
        such as Marth and Donkey Kong (the former is also his worst matchup).]]></string>

        <br>
        <br>Ice Climbers rank 7th on the tier list (in the B tier), highly accredited to the usage of Wobbling and Desyncing and the fact that the fighter is literally
        \"two-in-one", which helps the climbers rack up damage, combo, and KO opponents; this gives the Ice Climber\'s one of the best grab games in Melee.
        Additionally, good players can quickly rack up damage with the two, and they have good approach options on the ground, due to disjointed hitboxes and
        two decent projectiles. The two also have a very long and floaty wavedash, aiding their approach tremendously. The Ice Climbers, however, have a poor
        air game, and their floatiness causes them to be vulnerable to juggling and combos. Another vulnerability is that many of their benefits are lost if
        the second Climber is KOed.

        <br>Samus Aran is a starter character in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Returning as a veteran from the
        previous game, Samus, similarly to Link, reprises her role as a short-ranged fighter with numerous ranged options. In addition, she received some
        powerful buffs, causing her to improve from a bottom-tiered character in Super Smash Bros. to a high-mid tiered character in Melee.
        <br>
        <br>Samus is currently ranked 10th on the current tier list, placing her in C tier. This is mainly due to her numerous and effective projectiles
        , which adds to her KOing power and her approach on the ground. She also has a good air game, complimented with a powerful back aerial. Samus
        recovery is among the best in the game; her bomb jumps, ability to wall jump, grappling beam, and heavy weight all contribute to making her among
        the toughest characters to KO horizontally. She also possesses techniques exclusive to her, such as the Super Wavedash and Extended Grapple, that
        aid her approach on opponents. However, she is floaty, allowing her to be KO\'s vertically easily, and she has a below average combo ability due to
        a relatively low air speed. Her primary combo starter, her grab, is also very laggy if it misses, though it can be extended in the NTSC version.
        Regardless, Samus has a large amount of advantageous matchups, three of which are close to
        unloseable (against Roy, Yoshi and Pichu).

        <br>
        <br>Luigi currently ranks 13th on the tier list, in the D tier, placing him in the dead centre immediately above his older brother Mario. Luigi
        is notable for having some of the best aerials in all of Melee; they are very fast, very powerful and have very low ending and landing lag.
        Luigis wavedash is the longest in the game, taking him nearly half the distance of Final Destination at a high speed (only slightly slower
        than Captain Falcon\'s dash). Luigi also has a wide array of efficient combo and KO moves both in the air and on the ground. Luigis traction
        is the lowest in the game; while it gives him an excellent wavedash, it also limits some of his approaches on the ground if hes not wavedashing,
        as well as his out of shield options (as he often gets pushed too far away for fast follow-ups when his shield is hit). His approach options
        are generally poor; he struggles to approach on the ground despite his excellent movement due to his short range and lack of disjointed hitboxes,
        while his aerial approaches are hampered by his high short hop and slow falling speed (giving him one of the worst SHFFLs in the game) and his
        extremely poor aerial mobility. This problem is compounded with his difficulty in forcing opponents to approach (mainly as a result of his very
        poor projectile). Additionally, his recovery is easy to edgeguard, being very linear
        and slow despite covering a large distance.

        body; coupled with sub-par options in the air and a short wavedash, Pikachu overall
        has a poor approach

        <br>Roy is a secret character in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Roy is a clone of Marth, with all of their moves having
        the same animations and most having similar functioning, although they do also have their differences in their fighting styles (primarily in the
        location of their sweet and sourspots). Like Marth, he is a hidden character, making Roy the only clone of an unlockable character.
        <br>
        <br>Roy is currently ranked 20th on the tier list, in the F tier. Roy\'s upsides include a good approach due to one of the best SHFFLs in the game, as well
        as a good grab game, and among the best reaches in the game. However, Roy\'s flaws are significant, including poor flexibility in his comboing
        game, attacks that are difficult ito properly land, generally possessing significantly laggy attacks, possessing few moves that can KO and only
        one of which (forward smash) that is an adequate finisher, and among the worst recoveries in the game while being a light character that is
        heavily susceptible to combos; as a result, Roy has significant KOing problems while being easy to KO himself, leading to numerous matchups
        hard countering him, especially against those who are higher-tiered than him.]]></string>

        <br>Yoshi is currently ranked 12th on the current tier list, in the D tier. Yoshi has outstanding combo ability with his double jump canceling (especially
        against fast-fallers like Fox), a great aerial game (coupled with the third most powerful meteor smash in the game), and some decent approach
        options. He can also play mindgames and extend combos with his unpredictable Egg Throw, and has a very reliable finisher in his down smash,
        which has almost no start-up lag, outstanding reach and knockback, and a very favorable launch angle that is hard to DI against or recover
        from. However, Yoshi has a number of significant flaws. One is his lack of a \"true" third jump, which creates a reliance on his large double
        jump; although it gives Yoshi super armor, he has almost no chance of recovering if he is hit out of it. His high falling speed also makes him a
        target for combos. Additionally, his shield acts as a double-edged sword; while it protects Yoshi from shield stabs, it cannot be jumped out of,
        limiting Yoshis defensive options. Yoshi has poor matchups all around, with five matchups considered nearly unwinnable, and only one being
        considered favorable against Kirby; he also has the dubious distinction of being one of only three characters that have an even matchup against
        Pichu. However, due to large innovations in Yoshis metagame by aMSa, as well as strong tournament placements by him, Yoshis placement on
        the tier list and matchups have been debated in the Melee community. When aMSas results are not counted, however, Yoshi has had one of the
        worst representations in top-level play.

    <string name="bait_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Baiting</b></big>
        <br>Baiting is practically using your knowledge of your characters weaknesses and your opponent\'s reactions
        to trick your opponent into putting themselves into a weak spot or vulnerable point.
        <br>This is done by recognizing and remembering an opponent\'s reaction to a particular situation and inducing
        that situation in order to punish their reaction. In other words, this is punishing a player\'s habits.
        <br>An example of baiting commonly seen in competitive play is punishing laser habits from Falco with powershielding.
        In Melee, many Falco mains fire lasers recklessly, or only fire lasers from a specific distance. By memorizing the
        timing and spacing a Falco player fires lasers at frequently, one can move to that spot, read the laser, and prepare
        to powershield the laser and follow it up with a grab or an aerial.
        <br>
        <br>It\'s best to bait when you notice your opponent\'s patterns and you are in the position to
        exploit their flaws. Only bait when you\'re sure you have room to act before getting punished, or else
        you\'ll take more damage than it is worth.
        <br>Make sure you don\'t bait your opponent the same way several times or else they\'ll learn to stop
        making the same mistakes.

    <string name="control_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Control</b></big>
        <br>Control is practically being able to control the stage, approaching opponents
        in a way that they are not able to escape a stick spot, like edgeguarding against a Falcon, as his recovery is easy
        to predict.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Why you should control</b></big>
        <br>Why is the ground so important? The ground is important because it\'s generally
        where a player has the most options and the safest options.
        <br>First, the ground is where you have the most mobility. When you\'re on the
        ground, you can dash, wavedash, walk, and basically go anywhere, as opposed to
        being airborne, where you are limited to the relatively short arc of your jump.
        To visualize this, let\'s think about the threat that Marth poses to you on the
        ground vs in the air. Whenever Marth is on the ground, you have to worry about the
        long range he controls with his tilts and his other ground moves, and you essentially
        have to respect a much larger area because he has a lot of freedom to go wherever
        he wants. Whenever he is in the air, his effective range becomes much shorter,
        limited to the max distance of his jump. Whenever he is airborne, not only is his
        effective range shorter, but he has much less freedom to control where his character
        goes (he\'s limited to how far he can drift his own character along with his double
        jump). Double-jumping is a cool mechanic that gives you a little more
        maneuverability when you\'re in the air, but ground control is still king.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to stop being controlled</b></big>
        <br>Once you know the problems associated with your bad situation and why they are bad, you can begin to analyze these
        problems and/or solve them as well as possible. When having less movement options, you might be concerned
        about remaining unpredictable. So, this means you must know and abuse every single movement option you have in order to be
        unpredictable and not killed here. Economic dash dances(not excessive movement, but enough to feign an approach and varies
        widely in speed), very precise wavedashes, jumping. Use the options you have to their max potential, break out of
        that control your opponent has on you by analyzing the situation.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Gaining control</b></big>
        <br>In order to control the stage, you have to be aware of your weaknesses and
        best positions, some characters like Falco work the best from the center of the stage, due to his short recovery.
        But Marth for example works best at the edges, has he has no ranged options and is extremely proficient at edge guarding when
        handled properly
        <br>One example is a Fox vs. Falcon. If they go on to Final Destination, the Falcon won\'t have too many options at the edge,
        Fox has the ability to block almost every option Falcon has. If you\'re the Fox, make sure you cover as many options as possible,
        like going for the ledge and then takign advantage of the invincibility to go in for a quick shine or some other punish.

    <string name="edgeguard_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Edge guarding</b></big>
        <br>The most important thing to remember about edge guarding is, against the
        majority of the cast IT IS NOT A GUESSING GAME.
        <br>
        <br><b>Here\'s my simple 5 step edge guarding guide for beginners:</b>
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Hit them off the stage.
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Hit them again if they are still close to the stage. (Don\'t let a Falco Up-B really close to the ledge.)
        <br><b>Step 3:</b> Grab the ledge. You may need to regrab the ledge for invincibility
        depending on who you are edge guarding, ie: Marth. Overall it\'s a
        good habit to get into. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d95uCpFeYQ&feature=player_detailpage#t=48s
        <br><b>Step 4:</b> Stay on the ledge and WAIT!
        <br><b>Step 5:</b> Did they make it back onto the stage? If so, hit them back off. If not just roll.
        <br>
        <br>Edge guarding revolves around taking away your opponent\'s \"sweetspot the ledge\" option. Once you have taken
        their ability to sweetspot, they have no safe option to get back onto the stage.
        Here are some of the most blatant example of the effectiveness of taking away your opponent\'s sweetspot option:
        <br>
        <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=vphTto5RzLc#t=30s
        <br>
        <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=OqLFffh4Z-g#t=30s
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Character specific info</b></big>
        <br>Here are some other character specific examples of the different ways you can take away your opponent\'s option to sweetspot:
        <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=FLcYHYTr-Vk#t=47s
        <br>
        <br>Mew2King takes away Amsah\'s sweetspot option with a dtilt and forces him on the stage. Nevermind
        the fact that he did not punish him as hard as he could have when he landed on the platform. Don\'t have
        results oriented thinking. Recognize that he took away Amsah\'s best option. Leave it at that.
        <br>
        <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=1lxMKNyKuRU#t=76s
        <br>Armada knocks Zhu off stage and throws a turnip. Look where he threw it though, right in the spot
        where Zhu could have Side-B sweet spotted the ledge. This forced Zhu to upB to avoid the turnip and
        allow Armada an easy bair edgeguard. Peach\'s turnips are the way she covers options for edgeguarding.
        <br>
        <br>[There are a lot of character/matchup specific ways to edge guard on reaction. Learn the ways in which your
        character can take away sweetspot options against other characters and land easy edge guards! Ie: Falcon
        players will grab or regrab the ledge against spacies right when they see them start to charge their upB.
        His ledge invincibility will last long enough to take away their sweetspot option]

    <string name="improve_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Words on improving from PPMD</b></big>
        <br>Setting short term goals for friendlies is the easiest way
        to start pathing towards improvement. It really and truly helps to have a
        structured goal to work towards, even if it\'s relatively simple.
        <br>It doesn\'t have to be anything complicated. Trying to set up specific situations
        so you can test specific options is an easy way to start working towards this mindset.
        <br>Example: \"I want to wavedash back when he jumps towards my shield\"
        <br>That\'s a really simple goal that you can achieve with limited alteration to your
        play. Once you start getting used to setting simple, short term goals, you can start
        \"multi tasking\" and setting multiple goals that you can perform in a match as the
        situations arise as opposed wholly focusing on a single setup. You can start having
        \"branching goal paths\"
        <br>Example: \"Okay, I can WD back on reaction now. I want to WD back on reaction to
        my opponent coming in from specific distances.\"
        <br>You can have a small short term goal for each distance for X character and so
        on and so forth.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Don\'t get competitive in friendlies</b></big>
        <br>Too many people get "too competitive" when playing friendlies and focus hard on
        \"winning\" or \"not getting bodied\" which tend to occupy their entire decision
        making trees. Friendlies are basically an infinite resource. You can play as many
        as you want (assuming no time constraints) so it\'s more than okay to lose a couple
        matches and get bopped as long as you pull something out of it. I\'ve gotten four
        stocked by significantly worse players plenty of times because all I want to do is
        test a certain option. I disregard neutral and stock count because I\'d rather try
        to do something than win this one friendly out of 100 that we played.

    <string name="mindgames_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Mindgames</b></big>
        <br>Why are mindgames important? It\'s pretty obvious. If you are in your shield, and I know that you will
        try to roll past me because you ALWAYS DO, then how easy is it for me to punish your roll? You roll every
        time, and because you can\'t break your own patterns, I can exploit it. If you do the same thing in every
        situation, then you are incredibly easy to beat. It\'s the reason why players can stomp all over CPUs;
        they follow the same patterns, and then they lose.
        <br>We run into a problem though: how can you incorporate mindgames into your game? If you aren\'t in the
        habit of thinking while you play, how can you break that lethal habit?
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to incorporate mindgames into your play</b></big>
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Record yourself playing, and then watch; try and guess what you\'re going to do. If you see
        yourself do the same thing over and over again, then it should hit you like a ton of bricks that you
        need some work. This should give you motivation.
        <br>
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Play against predictable opponents. This should also help you realize, first hand, that a
        player who never mixes up patterns is a player that loses constantly.
        <br>
        <br><b>Step 3:</b> Now you\'re actually ready to start incorporating. You need to start slowing down how you play.
        Don\'t even worry about winning. In fact, it might help if you just play matches with infinite time limits
        and no stocks against your training partner of choice. Start by trying to guess what your opponent is
        going to do. Don\'t even really try to respond or retaliate. Just focus on calling your opponent\'s moves,
        one after the other. Watch your opponent, and forget about yourself.
        <br>Some people will probably complain right here: they will say, "you aren\'t supposed to think so hard
        while you play. If you\'re busy consciously analyzing everything, you'll be slow and can\'t react and won\'t
        even make decisions." That\'s correct. Absolutely true. But in order to integrate mental habits, they must
        be conscious decisions first. If you don\'t think while you play, then you have to make yourself think. You
        have to make it a conscious decision, all the time, while you play, until it becomes a habit. Once it
        reaches the unconscious level and you\'re not auto-piloting, then you will know you\'ve hit a good point.
        <br>
        <br><b>Step 4:</b> Focus on breaking your own patterns. Again, watching videos helps. Try doing different things
        in the same situations. Adopt other people\'s techniques. If your friend always shield grabs, and another
        friend jumps out of shield, and another friend rolls away, and another one spot dodges, try each tactic
        out. Get yourself in the habit of breaking habits.

    <string name="mindset_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Mindset</b></big>
        <br>Results oriented thinking is as it’s described, playing with the mindset of being focused on a result.
        This is what makes a noob. Being a noob has nothing to do with how good or bad a player is. Being a
        noob is having the aforementioned mindset.
        <br>
        <br>I go back to a conversation I had with Lance at the dining courts. After a whole bunch of B.S. about
        how he thought I was carrying him in teams at a past SG tournament and me trying to convince him otherwise,
        he brought up \“that one time we lost a match to cykofox and alcheato\”.
        <br>I remember the look on his face when he asked me \“Where should we counterpick?\” after they took one
        game from us. He had a look of slight distress, and I could tell the match got to him. However, for
        me, at no point during that set did I \“lose\”. Mentally, I was in control. We held the momentum for
        the whole set, so it put the team in danger for Lance to think we were somehow behind. That is results
        oriented thinking. Some ask what is wrong with thinking like this. What is wrong with being focused on
        results? That is what I’m after right? The answer is yes. Everyone wants to improve because everyone
        wants results. The problem is the way in which you are going about trying to achieve those results.
        <br>These things do not come overnight. They come through practice, and a mentality of \“playing to learn\”.
        Success comes as a consequence to this.

    <string name="mixups_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Mixing up</b></big>
        <br>The mix-up game has been a part of traditional fighters going all the way back to the days of Street Fighter.
        It is defined as a way of altering your patterns of attack in order to get past your opponents defense so you
        can nail a combo, grab, special, etc. There are many kinds of mix-ups, and this will discuss the many
        mix-ups that Smash has, as well as their usefulness and their application. Some of them will be
        reminiscent of traditional fighters and others will be unique to SSBM. After reading this post you will
        be further convinced of the depth behind Smash and you will see just how effective mix-ups really are.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Purpose of mix-ups</b></big>
        <br>The purpose of mix-ups is a simple one. They are used to get in damage, and remain unpredictable. If you
        were unable to mix-up your attacks in a traditional fighter, it would be that much harder to get hits in and
        win matches. This is where shields, attacks, and grabs come in. The developers foresaw that shielding would
        be broken without some kind of flaw, so they created some. If you hold the shield too long, it will break.
        Shields also shrink the longer you hold them, they get reduced as they take hits, they take time to
        regenerate, and they can be shield stabbed.
        <br>To help mitigate all these weaknesses, shields can be tilted for better coverage of a given area, or
        they can be made lighter and wider for more coverage overall. It is also possible to roll or spot dodge
        from a shield. With this formula the developers of SSBM set the stage for many creative mix-up games.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Approach</b></big>
        <br>Approaching an opponent adds a layer of depth in of itself. You can approach a number of ways. Dashing,
        wave dashing, SHFFLING, come in with a projectile, empty SHFF, JC grab, JC attack, etc. Still it can all
        be broken down into 3 different things. Attacking, grabbing, or shield stabbing. You grab if they like to
        stay in their shield. You attack if you want to pressure them or you think they will attack and you want
        to stuff their move.
        <br>
        <br><b>Shield stabbing example</b>
        <br>Everyone has gotten a shield stab
        off before. You probably just thought it was luck and you just went from there. But what if you started
        actively looking for opportunities to shield stab? What if you take it to a level beyond that? What if
        you try to pressure someone\'s shield to the point where you know you can get an easy shield stab?
        <br>Let\'s say you are playing Captain Falcon. Your opponent is at 110&#37; damage. One knee will easily finish them off.
        You want to get a knee off easily. You might say just go for a grab to d-throw to knee right? Well,
        that is one route. But you could also pressure their shield with sweetspotted knees in order to whittle
        down their shield. The knee has enough shield stun for Captain Falcon to get away unharmed so you could
        repeatedly pressure them if your good enough. Then once their shield is low enough you can get an easy hit
        on an exposed body part.
        <br>Let\'s say you rush your opponent and they just know that you want to get that
        knee off, so they angle their shield upwards. But then you just land harmlessly and then d-tilt hitting
        their exposed lower body and finishing them off with a full hopped Uair. MINDGAMES!!!!!!

    <string name="neutral_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Neutral game</b></big>
        <br>In the Neutral game, the balance of options each player can perform is at a relative equilibrium.
        In this state, the Advance/Attack/Avoid paradigm is most prevalent and the players interact with
        each other in this manner until a mismatch of the interactions occur or one player gains a
        positional advantage.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Mindset for neutral game</b></big>
        <br>This is when you are actually starting to play Melee in a way comparable to respected players.
        This is when you learn everything about every character. You learn their ranges, their recovery options,
        their frame data, their positional weaknesses, etc. It\'s time to start theorycrafting and to truly
        understand the utility of all your options. You\'ve probably been watching videos for your whole Smash career,
        but now is when you really learn to analyze them. Learn to understand why players choose to do what they do,
        not just admire how sick their combos are. Watch videos with analysis by top players and make sure you
        understand everything they say. You will now get hype over things that you didn\'t notice before, and
        things you got hype over before will now seem standard. Though we have amazing resources like smash
        labs, where Melee\'s elite have shared their insights going into their thought process, I find myself now
        thinking that the neutral game has some ineffable quality to it that makes it difficult for me to give useful
        advice at this stage. Once you have mastered control over your own character, and you have learned to watch
        the other player, things will start to click.
        <br>
        <br>The beauty of the game doesn\'t really shine through until you are at this stage. There are a few things
        that come to my mind that puzzled me for years. I always heard about stage control and about momentum of the
        match. Yet it was difficult to see how control of the match influences decisions about when to attack and
        when to evade. The lack of understanding of these concepts is obvious in new players because of how frequently
        they throw out attacks from defensive situations. As your ability to understand other characters blossoms so willl
        your ability to mindgame other people. After hearing "rolling is bad" for years, neutral game is when you should
        finally have enough situational understanding to bait and punish them. Once you understand the options a
        character has, the brilliance behind the decisions of top players becomes clear.

    <string name="reading_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Reading</b></big>
        <br>Reading is successfully knowing what your opponent will do next. If a player can read properly, he can exploit
        several flaws of the other player and take several stocks from them just because of the players ability to know
        how to respond to the prediction.
        <br>There is a major difference between guessing and predicting. There are tons of different methods of fighting
        that put you at really good positions, but there are also the ones that put you in bad positions. On your good
        days, you do mostly the good ones; likewise for the bad. When you\'re guessing, you don\'t have any idea why
        your style was working or wasn\'t working. While predicting, you can see where you messed up because of a wrong
        option you took. Guessing is playing a chance game.
        <br>I\'ve tried to break these things up into easy-to-learn sections. Not knowing why I was have good and bad days
        frustrated me enough to re-evaluate what was going on. These are all my opinion from my experiences, take them as you will.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Learning to notice patterns in play habits</b></big>
        <br>From where is your opponent is approaching(or camping from?)
        <br>Is it usually an aerial approach?
        <br>Is it a running shield approach?
        <br>Is it a running grab approach? etc.
        <br>
        <br>What are their primary methods of approaching(or camping?)
        <br>Shield, Dodge, Grab, Specials, Smashes, Tilts, Aerials, and Jabs are their options. Learn how they all work.
        <br>
        <br>What does the opponent do when they\'re under pressure? (being attacked/approached-even a simple run animation reflex)
        Do they Shield-grab, Shield-OOS option, roll, spot dodge, jump, sit in their shield, or even attack are the majority of reflexes.
        <br>When they\'re in the air, empty short hops are nice to bait air dodges into Fsmashes.
        <br>
        <br>These are the positions one should observe (while their playing or not) and try to figure out
        what the playing habits are. Keep in mind, the
        higher caliper player means more mix up and less predictability.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Knowing the best option for the read</b></big>
        <br>For example, if Falcon threw someone forward and that someone air dodged, Falcon gets a free grab
        when predicted. Falcon also gets a short hop forward falcon punch in the same prediction(if it doesn\'t work,
        pretend it does for the example.) Which option would you choose?
        <br>Second example, as Falco, if you jab someone and predict them to shield after it, the best
        option would be to grab them. You can\'t Fsmash them for that prediction because the shield they
        were doing anyways would block it or you would get shield grabbed during the beginning animation of the Fsmash.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Implementing this into your game</b></big>
        <br>Learning to deal with the stress of making educated guesses all of the time is important for your
        growth as a player. You\'re not always going to get it right, so have a back up strategy in case it
        falls through. Try not to stray from smart options into easy options because you messed up a prediction.
        <br>Learn what annoys the opponent and use it(in other words, your back-up strategy). It will make them more
        predictable, making life for you a hell of a lot easier. If you\'ve done everything else right, and this
        prediction doesn\'t put you in an extremely bad position, then go for it.
        <br>One should never be going for predictions all of the time. A player needs to stay back until they
        see an opportunity. A player also needs to apply pressure when they\'re staying back. This strategy
        should be safe for the most part until a prediction is made. Laser camping until their shield is low
        is a good pressure strategy.
        <br>Don\'t get me wrong. I don\'t mean camp until you see one opportunity, hit once, then run back
        (unless you like that.) People are allowed to attack close ranged and throw in multiple predictions.
        You don\'t need to hit the opponent either while distance pressuring.
    ]]></string>
    <string name="pressure_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Pressuring</b></big>
        <br>Pressuring is the act of limiting an opponent\'s options in order to force them to
        react. Like baiting, pressuring is used to lure out some sort of punishable
        action, but the difference is the action is lured out more aggressively and the
        opponent\'s habits are not necessarily taken into account. Pressuring can also
        be stated as using your extra options to reduce your opponents options.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to pressure</b></big>
        <br>In order to properly pressure, there are two things you need to analyze about your
        opponent. Their play style (patterns, reactions, etc.) and their character\'s options.
        <br>By using this information, look at your opponent and see possible ways you can pressure
        them into doing an action. One example is a Fox vs. Falco, where the Falco is edge guarding
        the Fox. As the Fox starts his Side-B to recover, Falco shoots a laser and brings him lower, this means
        Fox cannot recover using the Side-B anymore, and is forced to use his Up-B, so this
        means the Falco has less options to cover and can more easily take the kill.
    ]]></string>
    <string name="punish_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Punishing</b></big>
        <br>Punishing an opponent\'s mistakes is one of the most important things you can do. This is because
        your opponents are going to keep on getting better and better, and they\'re going to make fewer
        mistakes. If your enemy misses ONE L-cancel in the entire match, you had better be ready to
        make him pay for it. But if you only get a free shield grab and then a small, 20 percent combo
        that doesn\'t go anywhere, what use was it? You should have made him pay as much as you can.
        <br>This, in fact, is one of the things that defines the current tier list. A character\'s ability
        to take advantage of an opening defines just how good you have to be to win with that character.
        <br>
        <br><b>Let\'s look at it like this:</b>
        <br>I make ten mistakes in a stock, and you only need to take advantage of ONE to KO me. So if
        your punishment is even at 10 percent capacity, you can KO me easily.
        <br>You make TWENTY mistakes in a stock and I need to take advantage of 10. I need to have at
        least 50 percent consistency to successfully KO you.
        <br>
        <br>For every one mistake you exploit, I need to exploit ten to keep even. If I am WINNING, then
        it means that I am exploiting your mistakes MUCH more than you are exploiting mine. This is why
        if I\'m beating your higher-tier character with a lower-tier, unless it\'s a really weird counterpick,
        I\'m probably a lot better than you. You have more openings and I consistently take advantage of
        them better than you. Add to that fact that lower-tiers have a tougher time even starting
        punishment (usually lack of range, speed, or priority), I look even better by comparison.
    ]]></string>
    <string name="recovery_info_text"><![CDATA[<big><b>Recovery</b></big>
        <br>Recovery is your ability to get back onto the stage. If your opponent knows where you\'re going to
        aim and how you\'re going to recover, you\'re at a loss. You need to look at all your options,
        and pick the best or least expected one in order to mix-up your game.
        <br>Learn your character\'s tricks and figure out how to maximize your control over
        yourself while trying to get back to the level.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Mixing up</b></big>
        <br>Most characters have some form of recovery mix-up.
        With Fox and Falco, you can Side-B to the ledge or above it, or you can shorten their Side-B\'s
        to trick an opponent into mistiming an attack. You can Up-B to sweetspot, or ride the ledge to maybe
        get a ledgetech. Peach might float above you, on top of you with an attack, or parasol then
        fastfall to the ledge. Samus has a fair amount of mobility while bomb jumping, and she might
        use her grapple to sweetspot or she\'ll sweetspot the up-B. Most characters have a couple recovery
        options, and it\'s your job to figure out what your opponent expects and do something else.
        And, of course, you need to figure out how they want to edgeguard you so you can respond to that.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Knowing your options</b></big>
        <br>Know what moves will help your character survive. Know that holding down when you reach
        the ledge makes you pass by it, and don\'t let that make you SD. You also need to know your opponent\'s
        edgeguarding options and how to reduce their efforts at keeping you off the level.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Spacing your recovery</b></big>
        <br>With good spacing comes sweetspots. Your recovery needs to put you exactly where you want to
        be, so you need to be familiar with the distance of your recovery moves. And it does you no good
        to repeatedly Side-B beneath the level with Fox or Falco and SD, or air dodge too low and fail
        to grab the level. Maybe you\'re Link, YL, or Samus and grapple too far away and miss the level, or
        you grab it too closely and go into freefall. Learn to space it, don\'t kill yourself and
        give the opponent a free stock.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Spacing</b></big>
        <br>Spacing is easily one of the most important aspects of
        Smash and fighting games in general. Everyone incorporates spacing into their game,
        whether it be intentional or instinctual.
        <br>The difference between a great player and
        a good player is that a great player is constantly conscious of it. A good player may
        play safe to an extent, but when they end up being out-played by a superior opponent
        and every move they throw out gets punished, they may not be sure why it\'s happening
        or what to do about it. The solution is to space more effectively. The reason you\'re
        being out-played is because your opponent is reading your every move and taking
        advantage of it. Back off, be more defensive, and disallow your opponent from reading
        you. You need to observe your opponent, pick up on patterns, and take advantage of
        all of their flaws.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Getting started</b></big>
        <br>How do you get started on developing your spacing? A good way is to try to
        visualize it when you are playing the game. When you are playing, try to imagine your
        opponent\'s quickest, safest options (for example, Fox\'s running SHFFL nair). The area
        that the opponent can cover with that option is their effective range (effective ranges
        vary depending on situation and matchup). Try to visualize this effective range, and
        then try interacting with it. See what happens whenever you position yourself right
        outside of it. See what happens when you go inside of it. Try to weave in, out, and
        around this range, and observe. This guide can\'t give you a three-step lesson on how to space.
        It can only point you in the right direction.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Explanation</b></big>
        <br>To put it simply, depending on where you and your opponent are positioned on the
        screen, one of the players has the advantage. For an example, if Fox is on the
        opposite side of Final Destination, and you\'re playing a character that can\'t attack
        from that distance, then Fox has the advantage. He can laser you safely, because
        there is nothing you can do to retaliate. This forces you to approach, which instantly
        puts you at a disadvantage.
        <br>The key to turning this specific situation around is to get
        close enough to Fox that he is unable to safely continue shooting lasers. And when
        I say close enough, I don\'t mean to run in and throw out an aimless aerial in
        frustration, because this is what Fox wants you to do. What you want to do is get
        close enough that you are still safe, but you impede Fox from continuing his onslaught
        of lasers. Once you get into this position, you can then look for openings or try
        to bait Fox into making a mistake that allows you to punish him.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Using it to your advantage</b></big>
        <br>Ideally, the only time you want to close the gap that you have created between
        yourself and your opponent, is when your opponent is in a vulnerable state; such
        as performing a laggy move, lying on the ground after a missed tech, or any other
        action that you can take advantage of.
        <br>After your opponent has been punished and
        has escaped the pressure, go back to spacing properly until you can take advantage
        of the next one or force your opponent into an unfavorable position. Isai wasn\'t
        kidding when he said \"Don\'t get hit.\" If you space effectively, learn your
        character\'s best positions on-screen, and quickly catch on to your opponent\'s
        habits, you will greatly reduce the amount of punishment/damage you receive and
        greatly increase the amount of punishment/damage that you can give.
        <br>
        <br>For every matchup, the spacing game can differ due to varying ranges and speed
        that characters possess. Once you begin incorporating a good spacing game, your
        overall game is sure to improve.

    <string name="techskill_info_text"><![CDATA[<br><big><b>Tech skill</b></big>
        <br>Your technical skill is your ability to execute commands. The ability to L-cancel consistently is
        part of your technical skill. The ability to short hop, wavedash, and move your character with
        absolute control is the ability to interact with the game fluidly.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Why tech skill is important</b></big>
        <br>Technical skill is the first thing we generally see in a player. When you see somebody SHFFL\'ing and waveshining
        across the level, you assume good technical skill. Technical skill also implies that you are aware of the
        higher levels of the game and that you are integrating advanced techniques.
        <br>Why is technical skill important? It\'s pretty simple. If you want to do something, but always screw up and
        kill yourself (or let the opponent do it for you), then you\'re in trouble, and won\'t be winning many matches.
        <br>Also, without technical skill, sometimes you can\'t exploit openings that might win you a match. If Marth
        forward smashes you and you shield it, if you can\'t wavedash from your shield consistently, he\'s free to smash
        your shield all he wants. You can\'t punish him, and you have fewer options. If you can\'t ledgehop, then you
        always have to stand up, attack, or roll onto the stage from the ledge, and that makes it a lot easier to
        punish you.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Questions you probably ask when trying to improve your technical skill:</b></big>
        <br>
        <br><b>Why didn\'t it work?</b>
        <br>Well, the simple answer is this: you did it wrong. More specifically, you pushed or let go of something
        too soon or too late, or you moved the joystick in the wrong direction. It\'s that simple. If you flub a
        wavedash, it\'s because you air dodged early and jumped. Or maybe you air dodged horizontally. Maybe your
        Falco\'s double ledge laser isn\'t accurate. You might be firing the laser too late after you ledge hop. If
        something isn\'t working, you have to stop and figure out what you pressed and when you pressed it; compare
        that to how the action is supposed to go, and then simply adjust.
        <br>
        <br><b>Why is it that when I play against a person I lose my ability?</b>
        <br>One, you\'re probably nervous and want REALLY BADLY to show off your tech skill. So you\'re trying
        too hard, and messing yourself up from within your own head. One solution to this is to start out slow
        and work your way up. Or come up with a warmup routine that you can actually do mid-match; maybe it\'s a
        movement pattern that gets your hands ready.
        <br>And two, you\'re splitting your attention between focusing on the enemy and
        focusing on your own actions. In training you focus on doing the combo, the execution, your fingers
        and the buttons. In a real match, you\'re usually watching the characters. When the movements aren\'t
        completely ingrained into your psyche, then you will lose focus on both halves of the match, and then
        you\'ll fall apart. The answer is simply this: practice better. Not more, BETTER. Just rehearsing the
        same combo won\'t work.
        <br>
        <br>While practicing tech skill, make sure you don\'t degrade in other fundamentals of smash.
    ]]></string>
    <string name="tips_info_text"><![CDATA[&#8226; Tech skill is step 1. Until then, don\'t worry about thinking and playing smart. You need to get your tech skill up the point
        where you can use it consistently (Don\'t drop easy combos, etc), and then afterwards you should work on applying it (mental game).
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; If you\'re practicing by yourself, just practice tech skill and get it consistent (wavedash 100x in a row without messing up, etc).
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; You can\'t get better if your mindset sucks. Mindset is more important than anything in Melee. If you\'re playing poorly, take a break.
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; Use friendlies to learn, practice, and try new things. Don\'t play friendlies to win. Keep notes in
        your head and take notes on what works and what you can improve.
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; Always think, even during friendlies! Don\'t autopilot! This is how you avoid hitting walls when trying to improve.
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; Between stocks, recall why you lost it. If you can\'t remember, you were autopiloting. It should be a quick
        recollection. (did you mis-space? miss a tech? get read?). If you get hit, ask yourself why you got hit and how you can avoid it next time.
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; After an hour of friendlies, take a break and review what you have improved on specifically. Spend the next hour
        improving another aspect that is lacking.
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; Every time you learn something, you need to play frequently enough that you make it a part of your game. Otherwise
        you\'ll be relearning it over and over again.
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; Think about the game when you\'re not playing so you can collect your thoughts.
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; Don\'t over think in tournament. Focus on the match but apply everything you\'ve learned up to that point.
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; Be balanced and work on everything. (edgeguarding, mindgames, combos, etc). Don\'t be good at just one thing.
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; Punish game is really important! (ex. Armada)
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; Don\'t be satisfied with your tournament placings. Be happy you got nth place, but the next day think about how you can get (n-1)th place.
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; In teams, look at everything. Don\'t focus on one thing at once. (Mango looks at the middle of the screen)
        <br>
        <br>&#8226; Every character is different. Try other characters and you might find a character that fits better with the
        type of player you are. Your play style really shows your personality. Tires don exits

        \n
        \nSit as far back in the chair as possible,
        with your back straight and shoulders back and relaxed.
        \n
        \nDistribute your weight on your hips evenly.
        \n
        \nKeep your knees at a 90 degree angle; your knees should be even with
        or slightly higher than your hips (try not to cross your legs).
        \n
        \nTry not to sit in the same position for more than 30 minutes.
        \n
        \nWhen getting out of the chair, don\'t use your waist or back to get
        up, use your legs. It helps to slide forward in the chair first.
        \n
        \nWith all that said, most people don\'t sit with correct posture
        (I\'m working on my posture) so implementing this for the first time
        at a tournament may not be a good idea.
        \n
        \nPractice good sitting posture when on the computer, practicing
        Melee, or whenever you\'re sitting. Doing so will get the correct
        muscles strong enough so it becomes comfortable.
        \n
        \nWhenever you\'re uncomfortable with your sitting position, change
        it. If your legs, back, neck, or shoulders are bothering you after
        a tournament, you should fix your posture.

        \n
        \n<big><b>Mental Exercise</b></big>
        \nMake and keep your mind quick and buff - by using it! Puzzles,
        thought-provoking movies, reading, board games, practicing
        remembering/visualizing things, and other video games are good ways
        to exercise the brain. Plus, there are tons of \'brain power\' games
        and sites these days (Luminosity is a popular site)
        \n
        \nA daily meditation habit has been shown to improve attention and
        focus, both very important for competitive play [Here are some guided
        meditations to help you out]
        \n
        \n<big><b>Physical Exercise</b></big>
        \nHaving good cardiovascular fitness will help blood flow to the
        brain, thus more \'mind power\' - helps improve memory and maybe even
        decision making abilities. You don\'t have to become a bodybuilder
        or tri-athlete, you just need to keep good cardiovascular and heart
        fitness. Aerobic exercises like running, biking, swimming, and even
        walking keep the heart happy. Anaerobic exercises are great too, as
        long as you keep your heart-rate up. Tip: If/when you\'re practicing
        techskill by yourself (vs a CPU or whatever), every stock you lose
        during your practice session is how many pushups/pullups/situps you
        do throughout the day (or right after practicing); or, for every
        stock that\'s how many minutes you\'re going to walk today or run/swim
        throughout the week. (Also, be sure to check out the SWF Gym thread
        to get in contact of other Smasher who want/like to exercise)​
        Rest your mind
        \n
        \nSometimes, you just need to stop thinking. On a day to day basis,
        and to rest from thought-heavy situations.
        \nA tournament can be hard on your mental capacities, so finding
        things to remove your thoughts from the stress, commotion, yomi,
        and whatever else your thoughts are on will be helpful in being a
        ble to focus throughout a tournament.​
        \nMusic in a pair of headphones helps \'remove\' yourself from the
        environment and give yourself a break.
        \nMeditation, though takes practice, can be invaluable to a competitor
        since it can help remove distractions at the tournament (or in your
        life), and help you focus.
        Any activity that takes your mind off things and doesn\'t require
        much (new) thinking: Juggling, tetris, drawing, sleeping, taking a
        walk, etc. Whatever works for you.
        \nIf you\'re feeling tired, try to take a nap. Even naps that are
        around 10 minutes can improve your alertness and performance (at
        least for a little while) - but don\'t sleep for longer than 30
        minutes.
        \nWhen trying to learn new techniques (or characters), it\'s good
        to rest your mind after the practice and learning - it\'s makes
        the learning more effective
        \n
        \n<big><b>Fuel your brain</b></big>
        \nYour brain LOVES glucose, and uses a bunch of it. So to make sure
        your mind has enough fuel, snack up on carbs during a tournament.​
        \nComplex Carbs: These are the long-lasting, time-releasing carbs.
        Whole grains, fruits, and veggies provide these. Recommended for
        your \'bigger\' meals when you have a good amount of down time.
        \nSimple Carbs: The short-term, instant-boost type of carbs.
        Basically anything that is artificially sweetened with sugar
        and corn syrup: candy, soda, chocolate, jam; and even fruits and
        juices. Recommended for the mini-snack in between/before matches.
        \nHunger Affects Decision-Making and Perception of Risk: Eat and
        think well.
