        <br>The boomerang superjump is a superjump glitch that can be performed by either Link or Young
        Link in Super Smash Bros. Melee.
        <br>It is done by throwing their boomerang, and then wall-grappling
        on a wall or the side of a stage. If performed correctly, the boomerang will fly into Link/Young
        Link and they will immediately fly high up into the air in a tumble animation and after sometime
        it will end, although if an action is done to cancel the tumble Link will stop rising in the air.

        <br>This glitch was removed from the 1.2 and PAL versions of the game.

    <string name="chillindash_info_text" title="Chillin dash" character="Falco/Fox"><![CDATA[<big><b>Chillin dash</b></big>
        <br>Fox and Falco can perform a technique referred to as Chillin dashing, named after
        Chillindude829, in Super Smash Bros. Melee. It is performed by running off the edge,
        and at the moment the character is going to fall off, the character must use the
        Reflector and perform a jump shine. Covering a decent distance, it is useful for
        edgeguarding. It is generally followed up by a jump canceled back aerial.
        <br>This technique is better to use than jumping off the stage to edge guard far away
        because the chillin dash travels farther than a jump by Fox or Falco.
        <br>

        <br><b>Step 1:</b>Sprint towards ledge (Slam grey stick horizontally)
        <br><b>Step 2:</b>Input shine right before you are about to leave the ground. (Release grey stick and shine, or quartercircle down into b input, both seem to work as long as you're quick)

    <string name="desync_info_text" title="Desynching" character="Ice Climbers"><![CDATA[<big><b>Desynching</b></big>
        <br>Desynching is an Ice Climbers technique that involves
        separating the two climbers' states and controlling them individually. It is most commonly
        done during grabs to allow Nana to attack a captive opponent or regrab them, but the Ice
        Climbers can be desynched out of many attacks, allowing the player to perform an attack,
        move, jump, or wavedash with either Nana or Popo, while inputting a different command
        to the other Ice Climber.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>The easiest way to start desynching is by doing an attack at the time the Ice Climber
        the player controls (usually Popo) can't attack, while the other can. For example, by doing
        an attack (with a certain timing) after a spot dodge, only Nana will do the attack. The
        timing can be practiced by taunting after a spot dodge; if only one Ice Climber taunts,
        desynching has been achieved.
        <br>Another way to jump desync is to lightly tap the control stick up, very lightly.
        If done properly, only Popo will jump and Nana will stay on the ground.
        <br>More info is here: http://smashboards.com/threads/new-no-setup-ic-jump-desync.366189/
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Continuous desynch</b></big>
        <br>Continuous desynch, as demonstrated in Two Climbers, Two Hands is a technique
        which involves keeping the Climbers acting individually for extended periods of time.
        In addition to making the Climbers much more powerful offensively, they also
        become harder to approach with continuous desynch.
        <br>Due to the extreme difficulty of
        timing and maintaining a continuous string of attacks, the in-combat potential of this
        approach is clearly substantial, but largely untapped.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Double jump cancel</b></big>
        <br>The double jump cancel, sometimes abbreviated as DJC,
        is a technique used by Ness, Mewtwo, Peach, and Yoshi, who can attack
        immediately after their double jump to cancel their upward momentum and land
        on the ground soon after their attack. This tactic is used to perform aerial
        attacks incredibly quickly, thus allowing aerial combos and KO's to be
        performed more quickly.
        <br>
        <br><b>Ness</b>
        <br>Ness can use the technique, though it is not very useful but still relatively powerful.
        <br>
        <br><b>Peach</b>
        <br>Peach can use this technique, but it is generally unused due to float
        canceling being significantly quicker and more useful.
        <br>
        <br><b>Yoshi</b>
        <br>Yoshi has the ability to "block the knockback" of attacks because of his
        double jump's unique knockback armor, and is often used to catch the opponent offguard with an aerial.
        <br>One downside of this is the lack of a standard recovery, so messing up and being taken offstage
        limits Yoshi's recovery options to a directional air dodge.
        <br>
        <br><b>Mewtwo</b>
        <br>Mewtwo gains a significant advantage from DJC. The best use of the DJC for
        Mewtwo is speeding up its forward aerial, though it can be used to assist its up aerial and back aerial as well.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>DJC physics</b></big>
        <br>Since the affected characters' double jumps are of the "delayed" type (where they do not rise immediately), interrupting
        the action with an attack will cause the scheduled upwards force to not take place.
        A similar mechanic can cause superjumps.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Double jump cancel fast fall L-cancel</b></big>
        <br>Double jump cancel fast fall L-cancel (abbreviated as "DJCFFL") is a tactic that is simply a quicker application of the
        double jump cancel, and is most often used by Ness, Mewtwo, and Yoshi in Melee. It allows the character in question to
        attack aerially even faster than with a SHFFL'd aerial.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Instant double jump cancel</b></big>
        <br>Double Jump Canceling works by allowing the user to perform an air attack while remaining close to the ground (most aerial
        attacks are performed at a short hop's distance from the ground). However, if the user performs a DJC with frame-perfect
        precision (known as an "Instant Double Jump Cancel" or IDJC), they will actually hit the ground before the hitbox from their
        air attack comes out. This is true of every attack for every character who can DJC.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Execution</b></big>
        <br>To perform this technique, the player must perform their first jump, then double jump just as they leave the ground, and
        perform an aerial around the start of the "rising" in the double jump. The player's double jump will be canceled and they will do the attack and immediately fall. The player may fast
        fall almost immediately. The result will cause the character using this technique
        to attack extremely quickly.

        <br>Captain Falcon and Ganondorf can refresh their double jumps by performing their Down-B attacks.
        This means they can jump, double jump, Down-B, and then double jump again.
        <br>This technique is often used when CF or Ganon have been smashed into the upper right or left areas
        of the stage, as a means of mixing up their recovery.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>When to use</b></big>
        <br>You should use this technique when you are sent upwards and off the stage high enough
        so that if you were to perform the Down-B you wouldn't SD by the endlag sending you into the bottom
        blastzone.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Edge-canceled eggs</b></big>
        <br>Edge-canceled eggs (abbreviated "ECE") is a
        technique for Yoshi that is performed by releasing from the edge, pressing
        down or away from the edge, double jumping, and then throwing an egg.
        After the egg is thrown, the player can grab onto the edge, canceling
        all lag and renewing the edge invincibility frames. Note that the invicibility does not cover all
        of the ECE, it ends after the egg is launched if performed perfectly.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Usefulness</b></big>
        <br>Edge-canceled eggs is a rather useful technique allowing Yoshi to
        easily camp, space, and play defensively while countering opponent approaches. The reverse edge-canceled
        eggs technique is a pretty risky but useful edgeguarding tactic if one can perform it consistently,
        giving Yoshi strong ledge play.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>The best way to do it is to start by simply double jumping higher than the edge, and throwing an egg, and letting yourself
        fall to the edge again. Then, slowly work your way down, reducing the amount of double jump you use each time. This way,
        you’ll get faster at it, and not die all the time. Also, remember that in battle, it is not the speed you can edge egg
        at that counts; it is whether you can time it right. The speed comes with time, but the timing is much more important.
        <br>Remember to always have your finger poised above the midair dodge button, especially when edge egging, because you never
        know when you might need to use it.

        The Peach labeled "LCAN" is using this technique, and suffers from 12 frames of lag.
        <br>Peach has a special sort of cancel in her toolbox. By performing an aerial out of her Float,
        all of her aerial attacks will suffer only 4 frames of lag as opposed to as many as 25(from her laggiest

    <string name="frozenturnip_info_text" title="Frozen turnip glitch" character="Princess Peach"><![CDATA[<big><b>Frozen turnip glitch</b></big>
        <br>The frozen turnip glitch is a glitch on the 1.00 NTSC version of Melee that
        will cause a turnip to not travel any distance when thrown and will remain frozen
        in air with the hitbox still active. The turnip will stay in place indefinitely
        and won't disappear after a set amount of time.
        <br>This means you can leave a turnip as a
        remote hitbox to temporarily control a part of the stage or set it offstage by the
        ledge to intercept an opponents recovery. The hitbox is deactivated after hitting
        an opponent but if the turnip is picked up and thrown the turnip will become frozen
        in this new position with a reactivated hitbox. When a frozen turnip has an active
        hitbox it can be used to repeatedly hit shields without deactivating the hitbox,
        the turnip will hit the shield every 17 frames until the shield is pushed out of range.
        <br>
        <br><b>Grab side effects</b>
        <br>The frozen turnip has a side effect of enlarging its grab range, the grab range expands
        each time it is thrown. http://gfycat.com/AdeptYellowBorderterrier (grey area is the grab
        range)
        <br>Since the turnips don't disappear and can be regrabbed and thrown this means
        that a frozen turnip could be used for the rest of the match and could essentially
        remove both the ability for either players to use tilts or jabs since it will cause
        them to pick up the turnip. The only way for the enemy to remove the turnip is to
        die with it in their hand. Peach is capable of returning the turnip to normal by
        using her parasol while holding the turnip.

        <br>The Gentleman is a jab technique that Captain Falcon uses to end his jab on the third hit,
        where he uses his knee. If a Falcon were to jab normally, he would do the rapid jab, which

        <br>The double jump knockback armor, (Also called double jump cancel counter, abbreviated DJCC)
        is a technique unique to Yoshi. Yoshi's midair jump has knockback
        armor and will continue its momentum after the appropriate freeze-frames are applied against all attacks with
        knockback below 120.
        <br>The DJ knockback armor utilizes this protection to allow Yoshi to jump into an opponent, take a hit, and proceed to follow up with a
        counterattack almost immediately.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform the technique, start by simply double-jumping at an opponent within their attacking range. They will likely
        attack the player, and Yoshi will absorb the hit (taking all applicable damage), and be able to immediately counterattack
        or float away in the direction they were previously headed. Any aerial or special move can be done immediately after impact,
        but the most common are Yoshi's faster aerial attacks (such as neutral aerial) or his Egg Lay.
        <br>This can also be used to recover by double jumping up to the stage and taking in the opponents hit
        to wavedash onto the stage and space yourself until you have space to fight.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Ledgehop double laser</b></big>
        <br>The ledgehopped double laser, or LHDL, is a technique that can be performed with both Fox
        and Falco, though it is far more useful and common among Falco players due to the superiority of his laser.
        <br>The technique was popularized in Melee by Japanese Falco player Bombsoldier. Though it sounds
        simple in theory, the real trick is having the lasers travel at the proper height that the player wants.
        <br>If the player simply ledgehops as they normally would and tap the special button repeatedly, they will likely end up with
        two lasers that are extremely high and not at the same height. So the proper way to LHDL requires the player to drop from
        the edge a small amount, full hop, start tapping B immediately after jumping,
        so that the player fires one laser as they pass the ledge going up, and the second as they fall back onto the
        stage.
        <br>A variation of this technique, that doesn't involve ledgehopping at all, is to run off the stage, drop for a bit, and use
        the midair jump to reverse double laser back onto the stage. The player Westballz commonly uses this technique.
        <br>This move is semi-unsafe if the opponent is right next to the ledge so players have done it less commonly since other
        players are able to punish them.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>The LHDL is done by dropping down from the ledge, jumping after a height similar to the gif above,
        and then firing two lasers by tapping B twice with proper timing, and controlling your movement with the control stick.

        It is performed by jump-canceling a reflector and

        pattern to be repeated. It is a very difficult and technically demanding technique and is often practiced at slower
        speeds in training mode, though it is easier to perform with Falco as his jump squat animation is 2 frames longer.
        <br>Note: To get the hang of multishining, timing is very important, especially with Falco. See the timing movement

        <br><big><b>Parry</b></big>
        <br>Also called supershielding, parrying is a technique used by Yoshi players that takes advantage of the
        invincibility during "guard on" (the 6 frames of invincibility at the start of the shield)
        as well as the ability to jump during this time. Instead of blocking attacks

        and then jumping or grabbing to avoid the lengthy unshielding animation.
        <br>You can also crouch and pivot parry.  Crouch parry allows you to cancel whatever you were doing (or

        cannot do normally.
        <br>

        <br>Parry can be performed by shielding (full press, not light shielding), and then
        immediately following up with one of the actions listed below. Note that the actions must be done within
        the first frame of shielding, as only the second frame is jump cancellable without any drawbacks; the
        other frames will cause shieldstun onto Yoshi.

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Pillaring</b></big>
        <br>Pillaring refers to pressuring an opponent's shield by utilizing a combination of techniques
        (SHFFLs, aerials, and shines) performed by Fox and Falco.
        <br>The term can also be used for a Falco shine to dair combo as the characters go up and down together, like "pillars".
        <br>Pillaring can lead to a defending player rolling out of their shield and being chased or having their shield broken,
        although the latter is rare in high-level play. Pressure from pillaring is usually relieved by a successfully performed
        shield grab or out-of-shield option, such as Samus's Screw Attack, Bowser's Whirling Fortress, or even Fox's shine.
        Characters with poor out-of-shield options are especially vulnerable because a successful shield grab requires very strict timing.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Execution</b></big>
        <br>Pillaring is performed by SHFFL a down aerial and immediately shining. The shine is then jump-canceled into another
        SHFFL'd down aerial, and the cycle continues. Grabs and other aerials can also be canceled into in place of the down
        aerial. This technique is sometimes used in tandem with waveshines and waveshine infinites and followed up with jabs or down tilts.

    <string name="psspike_info_text" title="Princess/Swordsman spike" character="Marth/Princess Peach/Roy"><![CDATA[<big><b>Princess/Swordsman spiking</b></big>
        <br>Princess/Swordsman spiking is done by using Peach, Marth, and Roy's counter to
        intentionally setup an invisible ceiling glitch on your opponent. For Peach
        Toad will send them in the same trajectory as normal while it will cause Marth
        and Roy's counter to send your opponent away for a short distance and then
        switch to falling straight down. Additionally if this is used on an opponent
        to the left of you and they are sent offstage then the invisible ceiling glitch
        will remain active on them until they recover back on stage or grab the ledge.
        Any moves hitting an opponent off stage will cause your move to lose any vertical
        knockback it has while keeping its horizontal knockback and hitstun the same.
        <br>This means moves with decent hitstun that normally have upward knockback will
        know turn into spikes or semispikes that Peach, Marth, or Roy can use to gimp
        their opponent. Even though there is no downward vertical knockback the hitstun
        is still there and gravity will pull them down.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Press L or R to shield
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Release shield by letting go of trigger or using any out of shield options (jump, roll, grab)
        <br><b>Step 3:</b> Counter one of your opponents grounded attacks
        <br><b>Step 4:</b> Perform an attack on the opponent while they are airborne
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</b></big>
        <br>This likely works because Peach's toad hitbox and Marth and Roy's counter
        hitbox are very similar to the hitbox of a shield and are color coded as the
        same type of hitbox as shields in debug mode. A standard invisible ceiling
        glitch is triggered by going airborne while still sliding back after a grounded
        attack hits an opponents shield. Which can happen by either getting hit out of
        their attack on shield or for certain characters by walking or dropping through
        a platform after hitting an opponents shield with a specific attack. Normally
        if you hit a counter it won't cause any of the shield push back required to
        trigger an invisible ceiling glitch. However once you have used your shield
        earlier on that stock when your opponent attacks your counter they will receive
        the same push back as they would have if they attacked the shield you were
        previously holding up.
        <br>
        <br>Your counter will still be able to trigger the Princess/Swordsman Spike
        until you release a shield when it is incredibly light or the next time
        you die. As far as I can tell moving around, fighting, or using the
        counter do not undo the glitched shield + counter hybrid.
        <br>
        <br><b>How the shield affects the spike</b>
        <br>How light or strong your shield is before you release it has an impact on
        how soon after your counter will trigger the invisible ceiling glitch and
        they will lose their vertical knockback. This is because how light your
        shield is reduces the amount your opponent is pushed back when they hit your
        shield. So if you release a lighter shield that is used for your counter
        they will lose their vertical momentum sooner. If you make your shield too
        light they may not have any sliding back momentum when your counter hits
        which means it will not trigger the invisible ceiling. If you are too
        slow when you release a hard shield the game may register the light
        shield during the time your spring pushed your shoulder button back to
        its resting position so try to release your trigger quickly or use an out
        of shield option to avoid the risk entirely. The stronger a move is that
        hits your counter the longer it takes for your counter to trigger the
        invisible ceiling and the lighter you can hold your shield while still
        triggering the invisible ceiling glitch.

    <string name="rigcancel_info_text" title="RIG cancel" character="Samus"><![CDATA[<big><b>Rising instant grapple cancel</b></big>
        <br>Samus has one of the best recoveries in the game. She can Walljump, Bomb Jump, Grapple, and has a very powerful Up-B.
        <br>One of the most versatile of these options is the Grapple. When used in the air, the beam can latch onto the side of
        the stage. Samus will dangle there until she presses Z or A to pull herself up. If she is grappled perfectly onto the
        ledge, she will sweetspot it upon reeling in. Otherwise, she will rise upwards with the momentum.
        <br>Samus can also airdodge upwards right before grappling to shoot upwards quickly. However, if she is too close to
        the stage when trying to grapple, the move will be canceled and she will go into helpless state.
        <br>By combining these two features (the rising grapple and the grapple cancel), Samus can quickly shoot up in a manner
        similar to her rising grapple, but with less lag at the end. This is because the regular rising grapple causes her to
        go into tumble state. Landing from tumble state will put you on the ground unless you tech it, but even
        teching is slower than simply landing from helpless, which only has 4 frames of landing lag. This is also much less
        than the 24 frames of lag suffered from performing her Up-B.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform this technique, jump close to the side of a stage. Next, Airdodge upwards and immediately press Z.
        If you were too far away, you will perform a standard rising grapple. But if you were close enough, the grapple
        will be canceled and you will fly upwards.
        <br>This is certainly not the safest recovery option for Samus, but it is very quick and if she fails to
        sweetspot the ledge, she suffers from very little lag when landing on the stage.

        <br>Jigglypuff's Side-B is Pound. It's a fairly strong physical attack that sets up the opponent to get
        rested and can punch its way through several projectiles.
        <br>One of the odd things about the attack is it can be angled up or down, unlike most Side-B's. By angling the
        attack upwards, you can effectively use the move as another form of jumping.
        <br>This technique can be used to gain both massive height or length boosts, meaning that if Puff gets stomped
        to near the bottom of most stages, she can make it back to the ledge if she has all her jumps left.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>This technique can be performed by simply doing the Side-B but rather than doing it straight you aim diagonally

        <br>
        <br><big><b>Short hop laser</b></big>
        <br>The short hop laser (abbreviated to SHL) is a technique usually performed by short hopping with Fox or Falco,
        using their blaster to shoot a laser, and fastfalling (although with Fox's you don't fastfall).
        <br>The technique has two variants; the short hop double laser (SHDL) and the short hop triple laser (SHTL), for which two and
        three lasers respectively are shot during the short hop and no fastfall is performed.
        <br>Kirby can also perform some of these techniques by copying Fox and Falco's blaster abilities using Inhale.
        <br>
        <br>Fox can short hop laser and short hop double laser. Both techniques are used to camp and "tack on" small amounts
        of damage, but are much less effective at stopping approaches due to the lack of hitstun that Fox's lasers deal. Fox's
        short hop laser and short hop double laser are considered more safe and flexible than shooting lasers from the ground,
        for a number of reasons. Short hops can be maneuvered toward or away from the opponent, and the lag caused by landing
        takes less time than that which occurs during a grounded blaster's ending lag.
        <br>
        <br>Falco can short hop laser and fast fall while doing so, allowing him to quickly dash after firing a laser, meaning it
        can stun the opponent and allow him to followup with a grab, shine, or other combo starter. His short hop laser is used
        to camp and disrupt opponents' ground movement and approaches. Continuous strings of Falco’s short hop lasers are faster
        to execute than continuous grounded lasers.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to SHL with Falco</b></big>
        <br>To SHL with Falco you must short hop, and on the way up press B. Once you reach the peak of your jump, press the control
        stick down to fast fall. Press B at different times to get different heights.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to SHDL with Fox</b></big>
        <br>To SHDL with Fox you must short hop, either by lightly flicking the control stick up or using X or Y, and then press
        B twice immediately after getting off the ground. You do not fast fall for SHDL.

        <br>Both versions of Samus' Side-B, Homing Missile and Super Missile, can have their
        endlag canceled by landing, similar to Falco's Laser and some other moves.
        <br>This technique can become even more effective when combined with platforms, as Samus
        can Land-cancel a Missile on a platform, and then fall through it and Land-cancel a missile
        on the stage. This essentially doubles the amount of Missiles that can be fired.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br><b>The fastest way to perform this technique is to:</b>
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Shorthop
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Fastfall at the peak of shorthop
        <br><b>Step 3:</b> Launch the missile (strictly) 1 or 2 frames after fastfalling
        <br><b>Step 4:</b> To repeat the cycle, input another shothop after being on the ground for 3 frames

            <br><big><b>Super wavedash</b></big>
            <br>The super wavedash (sometimes abbreviated as SWD) is a frame-perfect
            physics exploit in Super Smash Bros. Melee that can only be performed by Samus. If the player
            performs it right, they will go a very far distance (about as long as Final Destination),
            however, it is important to release the control stick after the player performs the move,
            otherwise their distance will not be as far. They can also "Bombhop" by pressing the direction
            they want to go right before the bomb explodes.
            <br>
            <br><big><b>Execution</b></big>
            <br>The super wavedash is a very complicated maneuver and takes a lot of practice to pull
            off. In order to do this, drop a bomb, and as Samus is hitting the ground, immediately
            hit the opposite direction desired on the 41st frame (approximately when Samus lands
            after dropping the bomb), then hit the direction desired on the 42nd frame. This will
            result in Samus sliding across the level, as if in a normal wavedash, but she will go much farther.
            <br>It is possible, with better timing to do a SWD falling from the air, but a bit harder since
            the player does not have the ground to judge the timing as he or she may fall though the air
            from different heights. It is also possible to cancel the SWD in order to avoid a self-destruct.
            Doing any move with the exception of jumping, Sidestepping, using the Charge Shot or Smash
            Attacks will stop the super wave dash.
            <br>
            <br><big><b>Detailed instructions</b></big>
            <br><b>Step 1:</b> Down b
            <br><b>Step 2:</b> Input the opposite direction you want to go just before Samus lands
            <br><b>Step 3:</b> Instantly input the opposite direction (where you want to go) on the next frame
            <br><b>Step 4:</b> Let go of the stick to go the full distance
            <br>
            <br><big><b>Crouched bomb</b></big>
            <br>When crouching and laying a bomb, as opposed to laying a bomb without crouching, Samus will skip the
            first 2 frames in the bomb animation. This means when performing the SWD, the player will hit the opposite
            direction they want to go on the 39th frame, then hit the direction they want to go on the 40th frame.
            In actuality, it still is the exact same position as the regular 41st frame and since they skipped the
            first 2 frames, it can still be argued as being the 41st frame.

            practical in TAS runs or for the very daring Samus mains. It is performed by doing the Super Wave Dash as normal, however on frame 46
            the player must hold down, shield on frame 47, and then immediately grab on frame 48. This causes the
            player to slide a considerable distance further than the Super Wave Dash.

            <br>The bomb animation actually ends on 53, but you can cancel the bomb it by crouching
            as early as frame 46. In order to retain the most momentum, you cancel bomb animation
            with a crouch and then grab as soon as possible. You cannot press Z directly out of
            crouch and grab, so you have to shield for at least one frame. You don't have to
            actually move the control stick down on 46 and press shield on 47. You can buffer the inputs.

        <br>Shine mining, a term coined and discovered by Darktooth is a technique
        performed by first shining in the location the player wishes to leave the
        shine mine. Then, when the player wishes to activate the mine, he/she must
        perform a shine drop through a platform anywhere on stage, and the mine will
        become an active reflector for exactly two frames starting from the 2nd frame
        after activation. It is important to note that the mine is only a reflector,
        no hitbox effects and that both actions (setting of the trap, and activating it)
        must both be performed while there is an active projectile on the screen.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>

        <br>Up-B cancels are a very good option out of shield, and are good to set up combos,
        stop shield pressure, mix up jabs and waveland onto stage followups. Just keep in mind
        the character you are attacking has to be closer than Dr. Mario's jab range.

    <string name="upbturn_info_text" title="Up-B turnaround" character="Mewtwo/Pichu/Pikachu/Sheik/Zelda"><![CDATA[<big><b>Up-B turnaround</b></big>
        <br>Characters who have a omnidirectional recovery that is similar to a teleport, such as Mewtwo or
        Sheik, have the ability to turnaround their Up-B. Characters like Pichu and Pikachu can take
        advantage of this to go the same direction twice, which is impossible to do without this technique.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To do this, begin your Up-B. Now at the startup of your Up-B (before your character starts
        to actually moves/vanishes), you must LIGHTLY tilt the control stick in the opposite direction
        you are facing. This tilt must be light enough so that you do not actually travel in that
        direction. The end result will be you traveling upwards and ending up facing the opposite direction.
        <br>Fox and Falco cannot perform this technique, however they can turn around if they touch a wall
        (like the side of FD) when performing the Up-B straight up.

    <string name="upbwalljump_info_text" title="Up-B walljump" character="Mario"><![CDATA[<big><b>Up-B walljump</b></big>
        <br>Mario can walljump out of his up-b attack, Super Jump Punch. Instead of going into
        the helpless state, Mario will be able to perform actions out of the walljump, like Up-B
        again or cape.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform the Up-B walljump a Mario must Up-B while touching the wall at the start and
        then tap the control stick in the opposite direction of the wall once Mario has
        begin to turn around (or a bit after the peak of the Up-B) so you can wall jump.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Applications</b></big>
        <br>This allows Mario to recover much better, due to the fact it allows him to Up-B twice or
        use his cape to stall before recovering. It can also be used as a good mix-up.

    <string name="vududash_info_text" title="Vududash" character="Luigi"><![CDATA[<big><b>Vududash</b></big>
        <br>When a character wavedashes off a platform or the stage, they lose their momentum when
        transitioning from the wavedash into freefalling. However,
        some moves will maintain momentum, such as Luigi's Fireball.
        <br>This technique is known as a Vududash, named after the Luigi main Vudujin
        it's edgeguarding in situations where Luigi is near the middle of the
        stage and the opponent is a good distance off-stage, as seen here.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform the technique, simply wavedash off a platform or stage, and press B right before sliding off.

    <string name="wallbomb_info_text" title="Wallbomb" character="Princess Peach"><![CDATA[<big><b>Wallbombing</b></big>
        <br>If Peach uses her Side-B and runs into a wall, she will bounce off of it. She can
        then perform the move again 29-35 frames later, and because the beginning of the
        moves brings her slightly upwards, she will rise up the wall. It is important to note
        that her Side-B can be tilted or smashed, similar to Samus' missiles. In order to
        wallbomb, Peach must use smash Side-B's.
        <br>This technique can be used to stall for time(though this purpose is generally banned at tournaments),
        but can also help Peach get high enough to grab the ledge with her Up-B, Peach Parasol.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>To perform a wallbomb you need to do it against a flat wall, and smash Side-B
        (meaning a side special with smash attack button timing, B and control stick at the
        same time), and let the stick reset to neutral, then perform the smash side special again.
        <br>This technique should be possible on FoD, Yoshi's Story and FD. Other stages too.

    <string name="waveshine_info_text" title="Waveshine" character="Falco/Fox"><![CDATA[<big><b>Waveshine</b></big>
        <br>A waveshine is a wavedash done immediately out of a shine.
        It can be done by Fox and Falco, and requires a very high level of tech skill as
        it is very demanding to implement it into your game.
        <br>Waveshining is also a popular mixup when pillaring an opponent's shield. The waveshine allows the
        Falco player to move behind an opponent's shield to not get shieldgrabbed.
        <br>For both Fox and Falco, the waveshine can be used as a method of spacing and avoiding the lag after
        a shine.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to waveshine</b></big>
        <br>A wavedash can be performed anytime a character is on the ground and can jump. The shine can be canceled by jumping
        shortly after it is initiated. This is known as jump canceling.
        To waveshine, use the shine, then jump cancel into a wavedash out of it.
        <br>It is often easier to use the X/Y buttons instead of the control stick because it is considered harder to wavedash
        with only the control stick. The logic is that to jump with the control stick requires the stick to go up. To wavedash,
        the succeeding angle is angled towards the ground. This makes for more complicated manual motions, and should be avoided
        in order to achieve a speedy waveshine.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Users of the waveshine</b></big>
        <br>
        <br><b>Fox</b>
        <br>The waveshine is generally used for combos with Fox. However, some characters fall over when shined. This
        presents a problem, and generally these characters are immune to waveshine combos. Note that if these
        characters crouch-cancel the shine, they will not fall over and can be treated as normal waveshine. Also,
        using an attack after the wavedash can cause a character who has fallen over to be "forced" to stand up
        (a jab reset). This is referred to as "Thunder's Combo."
        <br>A waveshine can be followed up by many attacks. The choice of attacks depends on how far the opponent is
        pushed away. For example, Peach is not pushed away very far at all, but Luigi is pushed very far away. As
        such, Fox's choice of move following a waveshine against Luigi is more limited.
        <br>Some of the most useful attacks used in conjunction are the up smash, grab, down aerial, or even another
        shine. Waveshining plays a vital part in Fox's infinite combo.
        <br>
        <br><b>Falco</b>
        <br>The waveshine is generally used to aid in Falco's vertical down aerial and shine combos. It gives Falco
        the added horizontal distance such that he can jump up and catch up with his opponent. This is especially
        useful against a DIing Fox. A waveshine followed by another wavedash makes Falco a combo machine.

    <string name="wobbling_info_text" title="Wobbling" character="Ice Climbers"><![CDATA[Examples of wobbling: http://oddshot.tv/shot/dreamhacksmash-2015092012552578/
        <br>http://gfycat.com/InbornObeseIbizanhound
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Wobbling</b></big>
        <br>Wobbling is an infinite grab technique exclusive to the Ice Climbers.
        When performed with the right timing, opponents cannot break out of Popo's grab
        and will continuously get hit; the technique can also be performed on all characters in the game except
        against another pair of Ice Climbers.
        <br>Wobbling received its name as a reference to American smasher and Ice Climbers main Wobbles; the term was
        reportedly first used by spectators after he claimed 9th place in NCT2 with considerable use of the technique.
        <br>In addition to standard Wobbling, a variation called Blizzobbling can also be performed, where Nana instead
        uses Blizzard to attack opponents instead of using a tilt. Like Wobbling, it is also inescapable.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>Here is a slightly more in-depth description on how to do it from Wobbles, note that if your opponent is
        less than 30&#37; they can struggle out of the grab.
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Grab.
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Make sure Nana, your secondary IC, is close to you.
        <br><b>Step 3:</b> Hit A to have Popo headbutt; Nana will jab.
        <br><b>Step 4:</b> Gently slide the joystick either forward or down so that when you hit A next, Nana will tilt.
        Make sure she does the tilt before the headbutt ends.
        <br><b>Step 5:</b> As you continue sliding the joystick to its maximum, press A rhythmically. You want your attacks to
        be spaced apart as evenly as possible.
        <br><b>Step 6:</b> Keep pressing A with the joystick held in the direction you've chosen. You don't have to move the
        joystick any more after this. Just keep it held to do the tilt you've chosen.
        <br><b>Step 7:</b> When you are done, discard the opponent. I recommend waiting until Popo headbutts then hitting the
        c-stick down. Your down-smash will come out fastest and your opponent will have no forewarning that you're
        going to hit them; if there is anything to tech off of, they won't be able to. They also may DI poorly, but
        odds are you will continue hitting them until DI no longer matters.
        <br>If you have trouble wobbling, check this video: https://youtu.be/QciuRXj5Q8E
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How it works</b></big>
        <br>Wobbling works by the existence of a mechanics exploit in Melee. When an opponent is grabbed, they cannot mash
        out of the grab if the character grabbing them is performing an attack. This is the basis behind how pummeling
        works; opponents cannot mash out when a pummel connects, but pummels are not fast enough to stop them from
        escaping in-between them. However, Popo and Nana are treated as the same character when attacking. Thus, players
        can exploit desynching to force them to attack in an alternating manner that does not allow enough time for any
        character to escape from the grab; the delay between the pummel and the tilt is minuscule if not nonexistent,
        and is humanly impossible to escape from.

        <br>http://gfycat.com/CanineComplexBullfrog
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Yo-yo glitch</b></big>
        <br>The yo-yo glitch refers to a glitch done using Ness's
        yo-yo. It can be used to attack or grab with near limitless range or attach certain single-hitbox attacks to
        Ness's body. The discovery of the glitch was a collaborative effort between VilNess, LonelyNess, and Dan
        Smith, and was spurred on by an innocuous video of an unknown Japanese player accidentally dropping a yo-yo hitbox.
        <br>The glitch can be performed in all versions of Melee.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Mechanics</b></big>
        <br>Ness's up smash consists of 3 parts each with its own hitbox: outreaching, spinning, and swinging. The
        yo-yo glitch drops the last hitbox of the up smash onto the ground and leaves it there until Ness gets KO
        'd or uses a non-projectile attack.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>How to perform</b></big>
        <br>Use Ness's up smash and hit any opponent or destructible part of the stage with the outreaching part
        of the yo-yo. Charge the yo-yo very slightly before releasing.
        <br>Make sure that, after the yo-yo is released into its upward swing, it doesn't hit anything else.
        <br>
        <br><big><b>Thunder Jacket</b></big>
        <br>A follow-up technique to the Yoyo Glitch discovered by Simna ibn Sind.
        <br><b>Instructions:</b>
        <br><b>Step 1:</b> Perform the Yoyo Glitch.
        <br><b>Step 2:</b> Use PK Thunder to floorblast yourself from the air or use PK Thunder to hit yourself into a ledge and grab it.
        <br><b>Effects:</b>
        <br>Attaches the hitbox of PK Thunder (Ness' recovery attack) to Ness' body.
        <br>Blocks most attacks that it collides with and hurts opponents and destructible stages.
